<i>BELLE AND HER PAPA.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-009.png" alt="D" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">Dear little Belle!</p>

<p>There she sat, upon a low stool,
doll and picture-book lying unheeded
at her feet, as she watched the slanting beams
of light which streamed in between the crimson
curtains and poured life and gladness
over all within the pleasant room. There she
sat, watching them thoughtfully, yet with a
half-smile upon her lips, as they travelled
slowly and steadily from spot to spot, now
over the carpet, now up the table-cloth, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
touching the gilded mirror-frame and making
it flash with added brightness, and now falling
softly on a vase of lovely flowers and
bringing out their brilliant colors in new and
more perfect beauty. And now in their noiseless
but busy march they fell upon her own
little self, the brightest and sunniest thing
in all the room, to the loving eyes which
watched her.</p>

<p>"What is my darling thinking of?" asked
Mr. Powers, breaking the stillness.</p>

<p>In an instant Belle was upon his knee and
nestling close to him; but she did not answer
his question till it was repeated.</p>

<p>"What were you thinking of, my daughter?"
he asked again, laying his hand fondly
on the little round head, with its short, dark
rings of hair.</p>

<p>"About sunbeams, papa," answered the
child, turning her eyes again upon the bar of
light, which was now quivering and shimmering
among and over the prisms of the chandelier
above their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, they are very pretty," said her father.</p>

<p>"But it was not about <em>those</em> sunbeams,
papa, though they did make the thinking
come into my head. It was about being a
sunbeam. I would like to be a little sunbeam,
papa."</p>

<p>"And so you may, and so you are, my darling,"
said the father. "You are papa's little
sunbeam, the brightest sunbeam he has on
earth; and his way would be very dark and
sad without you."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," said Belle: "you mean I am
your comfort, and you are my sunbeam, papa,
'cause you are my comfort; but I was thinking
I would like to be a sunbeam to other
people too. I wonder if I could. Maggie
Bradford says I could."</p>

<p>"I am sure you could, darling."</p>

<p>"Maggie does say such nice things, papa;
and so does Bessie; and sometimes when a
thing does not seem very pleasant, or as if I
would like to do it, they talk about it so that
it seems very nice indeed, and so very right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that I feel in a great hurry to do it. That is,
if I do not feel naughty; for do you know,
papa,"&mdash;and Belle's voice took a mournful
tone,&mdash;"do you know sometimes I am so <em>very</em>
naughty that I feel like doing a thing just
because I know I oughtn't. Papa, could you
have b'lieved that of me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Powers, smiling: "I could
believe that of any one, Belle."</p>

<p>"Could you, papa?" said Belle, solemnly.
"Well, that does make me a great relief; for
when I used to get good again after I had
been so naughty as that, I used to think I
must be 'most the wickedest child that ever
lived. But one day when I told Maggie and
Bessie about it, Maggie said sometimes she
felt that way too; and then we made each
other promise to keep it a great secret, and
never tell anybody."</p>

<p>"And so you keep your promise by telling
me," said her father.</p>

<p>"O papa! we didn't mean our fathers and
mothers. We don't think you're anybody."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," replied her father, taking
the compliment as it was meant, though
somewhat amused at her way of putting it.
"That is right, dear. It is better for little
children not to mean their fathers and mothers
when they promise not to 'tell anybody.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; and then you see you have
nobody but me to tell you secrets, so I would
feel too badly not to do it. But I want to
know about being a sunbeam, papa; how I
can be a sunbeam to 'most everybody, or to a
good many people."</p>

<p>"What did Maggie Bradford say about it?"
asked Mr. Powers: "let me hear that."</p>

<p>"Why, it was yesterday, when I was spending
the day with Maggie and Bessie," answered
Belle; "and it was cloudy, and the sun
came out from the clouds, and Maggie said&mdash;Papa,
Maggie is the smartest child; and do
you know what I heard Mrs. Norris say about
her? She said Maggie had quite a&mdash;quite a&mdash;a&mdash;talent,
that was the word, quite a talent
for poetry. Are you not very glad, papa, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
my in-sep-era-ble has a talent for poetry?
Don't you think that is a pretty nice thing for
a child to have?"</p>

<p>"Very nice; and I am indeed happy that
my Belle has such a talented friend," said
Mr. Powers, who knew that he could not
please his little daughter more than by joining
in the praise and admiration she showered
upon her young friends and playmates,
Maggie and Bessie Bradford,&mdash;"very nice,
indeed; but still I do not hear what Maggie
said about the sunbeams."</p>

<p>"Well, such a beautiful sunbeam came out
of the cloud, papa; and it made every thing
look so bright and pleasant, even though the
clouds were there yet; and I said if I wasn't
myself, I would like to be a sunbeam, 'cause
every one was so glad to see it, and it seemed
to make things so bright and happy; and then
Maggie said we could be ourselves and sunbeams
too. Not <em>really</em>, true sunbeams, you
know, but like sunbeams, to make all bright
and glad about us; and she said we did that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
when we helped each ofer, or when we tried
to make sorry people feel glad, and comforted
them, or did a kind thing that made some one
feel nice and happy. And Bessie and I were
very proud of her for saying such a nice thing
as that, papa; and we begged her to make
some poetry about it, and she made one verse;
and then Bessie said she b'lieved we could be
sunbeams for Jesus if we chose, and she coaxed
Maggie to make another verse about that, and
we learned it. Shall I say them to you, papa?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said her father; and Belle
repeated the following simple lines, which
she plainly thought extremely <span class="locked">fine:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I wish I was a sunbeam,</span><br />
<span class="i2">To sparkle all the day;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And make all glad and happy</span><br />
<span class="i2">Who came across my way.</span><br />
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'd like to shine for Jesus,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And show to every one</span><br />
<span class="i0">That all my light and brightness</span><br />
<span class="i2">Did come from Him, my Sun."</span>
</div></div>

<p>"There, what do you think of that, papa?"
she asked in a tone of triumph, which showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
her own delight and pride in her little friend's
composition.</p>

<p>"I think it very fair for a nine-years-old
girl," answered her father.</p>

<p>"I think it is be-ew-tiful," said Belle.
"Maggie writes lots and lots of po'try, and
she copies it all. Some of it is pious po'try,
and she puts that in one book called 'Bradford's
Divine Songs,' and she puts the unpious
in another called 'Bradford's Moral Poems;'
and Bessie and I learn a great deal of them.
They're splen-did, and she is just the smartest
child,&mdash;Bessie says she is."</p>

<p>If Bessie said a thing, it must be so, according
to Belle's thinking; and her father did not
dispute the fact. Belle went <span class="locked">on,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"And that is the kind of a sunbeam I
would like to be, papa, 'cause I s'pose that is
the best kind,&mdash;to have the light and brightness
come from Jesus,&mdash;and it would make
me nicer and pleasanter to every one."</p>

<p>"Yes, my darling."</p>

<p>"But I don't see how I am to be much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a sunbeam to any one but you, papa. Maggie
and Bessie seem to know how without any one
telling them, but I don't know so very well.
They are my sunbeams next to you, I know
that: are they not, papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, my daughter. God bless
them," said her father, speaking from his
heart as he remembered all that these two
dear little girls had been to his motherless
child; what true "sunbeams" they had proved
to her, cheering and brightening the young
life which had been so early darkened by her
great loss. Gay, bright, and happy themselves,
they were not only willing, but anxious, to
pour some of the sunshine of their own joyous
hearts into those of others who had not
so many blessings.</p>

<p>All this, and more than this, had her young
friends done for the lonely little Belle, not
only bringing back the light to her saddened
eye, and the smiles to her once pitiful
face, but also giving her a new interest by
awakening in her the wish to shed some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
happy rays on the lot of others, and leading
her by the shining of their own example to
become more obedient, gentle, and unselfish
than she had ever been before.</p>

<p>"Daphne told me I'll have a whole lot of
money when I am a big lady," continued
Belle; "and then I should think I could be a
sunbeam to ever so many people, and do ever
so much to make them glad and happy. I'll
build a room, oh, ever so big! and bring into
it all the lame and deaf and blind and poor
people, and make them have such a nice time.
The good ones, I mean: I won't have any
naughty people that do bad things. I shan't
be a sunbeam to them, or have them in my
sunbeam home; no, nor the disagreeable ones
either, who don't have nice manners or be
pleasant. I'll take ugly people, 'cause they
can't help it; but everybody can be pleasant
and polite if they choose, and I shan't help
the old things who are not. Ugh!"</p>

<p>"But that is not the way Jesus wants us to
feel, dear. When He was here on earth, He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
taught us that we must try to do good to all,
that we might be the children of our Father
in Heaven, who, He tells us, 'makes His sun
to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and the unjust.' Do you
know what that means?"</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;yes, papa, I b'lieve so,"
answered Belle, half unwillingly: "I s'pose it
means I ought to try to be a sunbeam to disagreeable
people, just the same as if they
were pleasant."</p>

<p>"Belle," said Mr. Powers, "do you remember
the story Mrs. Rush told you of Lem and
Dolly, those naughty, unkind children who
treated your little friends so badly; and who
were so disagreeable and rude in every way,
both in looks and behavior?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeedy!" answered Belle, in
quite a different tone from that she had last
used. "I never <em>could</em> forget that story; and
now I do see what you mean, papa. Maggie and
Bessie were sunbeams to poor Lem and Dolly,
for all they were so very naughty to them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear; and they lighted the path to
Jesus so that Dolly found the way to Him
before she was taken from this world; and by
all that we hear it may be that some ray of
light has fallen across poor Lem's way too."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Belle, eagerly; "and the ofer
day Maggie and Bessie's papa had a letter
from the captain of the ship what Lem is a
sailor on, and he said he was a real good boy,
and tried to do right all he could. But, papa,
you see I don't know any very dirty, ragged,
horrid children to be a sunbeam to; so what
shall I do? I s'pose when I say my prayers
I could ask God to let there be some <em>for</em> me.
I'll ask Him to-night to let there be six dirty
beggars, three boys and three girls, that I can
be good and kind to, and show the way to
Him. Wouldn't that be a good plan, papa?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think I would hardly do that,"
said her father, smiling. "There is quite
enough of misery in the world without asking
for more only that we may cure it; and some
of it is pretty sure to come in your way. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
any little child may in her daily life shed light
and brightness around her, even though it
does not happen to her to find any such special
work as was given to your Maggie and
Bessie; and with the will and heart to do it,
I think my Belle will be a sunbeam indeed to
all with whom she has to do."</p>

<p>Now as you may not know the story of
which Belle and her father were speaking,
you may like to hear something about it; and
you shall have it in a few words.</p>

<p>These two little girls, Maggie and Bessie
Bradford, the young friends of whom Belle
thought so much, went one summer to spend
the season among the mountains; and, while
there, fell in with two poor, neglected, and
wicked children, named Lem and Dolly Owen.
From these children, who seemed to love mischief
and wickedness for their own sake, and
to feel a spite toward all who were better off
than themselves, Maggie and Bessie, and indeed
all their family, had much to bear.
Every petty annoyance and vexation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
they could invent was tried by Lem and Dolly
to trouble and grieve those who had never
injured them. But although it did cost them a
hard struggle, the two dear little girls had forgiven
all this, and so won upon the miserable
outcasts by the sweet, forgiving kindness they
had shown, that the latter were at last
brought to look upon them as friends, and to
feel sorry for all the evil they had done to
them. Nor was this all; for by their simple
teachings and bright example they had pointed
out to poor, sick Dolly the way to Jesus;
and before she died she was led to His feet,
and knew that He could save her and take
her to dwell with Him. So, happy and trusting,
she had gone from a world where she
had known little but misery, to that other
and better home where sin and suffering never
come; while Lem, softened partly by his sister's
death, had been put under the care of
kind Mr. Porter for a while, and was now, as
you have learned from Belle's words, gone as
a sailor boy with a prospect and promise of
doing well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>All this, and much more which it is not
necessary to repeat,&mdash;since, if you choose,
you may learn all about it in a little book
called "Bessie among the Mountains,"&mdash;had
been told to Belle by some of Maggie's and
Bessie's older friends; and had, if possible,
increased her love and admiration for them.
She had received such tenderness and affection
from them herself, this motherless little
one, and their friendship had brought her such
new happiness and comfort, that it was not
surprising that she did indeed look upon them
as her "sunbeams next to papa," and love
them with her whole heart.</p>

<p>Whether Belle and her papa would have
talked much more cannot be told, for now
they were interrupted by a knock at the door;
and when Mr. Powers said, "Come in," a
waiter obeyed, bringing a note directed <span class="locked">to&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="lt023"><span class="in2em">"Miss <span class="smcap">Belle Powers</span>,</span><br />
<span class="in2em">Care of her Papa,</span><br />

<span class="in4em">New York."</span><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Happily, this note had not gone by post,
but had been brought by one servant-man who
knew for whom it was intended, and had
given it to another, who brought it directly
to the young lady whose name it bore. Otherwise,
I think it just possible that it might
never have reached her.</p>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-025.png" alt="&quot;T" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">"That is Maggie's writing," said Belle,
seizing eagerly upon the note, as
the man handed it to her. "I
s'pose it's about something nice: Maggie's
notes always are,&mdash;Bessie's too. Please read
it to me, papa."</p>

<p>Mr. Powers did as he was asked; and when
Belle had opened the envelope, which was a
part of the business she must of course attend
to for herself, read aloud these words, written
in Maggie Bradford's large, round <span class="locked">hand:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh! my dear, darling Belle,</span>&mdash;We are
so glad Bessie and I are that your papa has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
made up his mind not to take you away to
your home in the south this winter. And not
to have you go in that horrid steamer and sail
with monsters of the deep and be seasick,
which is such a horrible fate that I could not
wish it of my worst enemy of which I hope I
have none in this world or that which is to
come. And because we are so glad about it
we wanted to have a public rejoicing, and
mamma says we may, and if you don't know
what a public rejoicing is it means when people
are very glad about something and want
other people to be glad too and so they make
a great fuss and have something very nice.
And so in the present case mamma says you
can come and make the public rejoicing with
us to-morrow afternoon and Lily Norris is
coming too and Nellie and Carrie Ransom.
And mamma is going to let us have a very
nice supper and some mottos, of which she
knows you are fond as I suppose are all mankind
or ought to be if they have any sense,
and we think she is the very dearest mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that ever lived and I hope I shall be her grateful
child as I am yours till death and Bessie
the same.</p>

<p class="in4em">"<span class="smcap">Maggie Stanton Bradford.</span>"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I'll go, 'course I will," said Belle,
clapping her hands, as her father finished
reading the note; and too much accustomed
to going and coming to and from Mrs. Bradford's
house as she pleased to think it necessary
to ask permission. "'Course I'll go. And,
papa, isn't this a lovely note? and isn't Maggie
just the smartest child to write so nicely? I
think she writes just as good notes and letters
as big people: yes, I think hers are a good
deal more interesting than big people's. And
she makes me understand every thing too.
I'm glad she told me what a public rejoicing
was, 'cause I didn't know before; and isn't
that nice and pretty about not going away and
monsters of the deep?"</p>

<p>"But you must send your answer: Patrick
is waiting," said Mr. Powers.</p>

<p>"Oh! to be sure," said Belle. "Please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
write it for me, papa;" and accordingly her
father wrote as she <span class="locked">dictated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Maggie and Bessie,</span>&mdash;I guess I
will; and I thank you very much for making
a public rejoicing, and mottoes and all. Your
mamma is so good; and I love her and you,
and hope I'll be a sunbeam to everybody.
Good-by.</p>

<p class="cont"><span class="in2em">"Your own precious</span><br />
<span class="in4em">"<span class="smcap">Belle</span>."</span></p>

<p>On the afternoon of the next day Belle was
taken to the home of her young playmates by
Daphne, the old colored nurse who took care
of her. She was in very good time, you may
be sure; for she insisted on going immediately
after her own early dinner; and Daphne was
too much accustomed to giving her her own
way in all things to dream of disputing her
wish.</p>

<p>The preparations for the "public rejoicing"
were not quite finished, as might have been
expected; but that did not much matter where
Belle was concerned, for she was so much with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the little Bradfords that they looked upon her
almost as one of their own family; and she
was at once called upon by Maggie to "help
with the arrangements," which she was quite
ready to do.</p>

<p>"Mamma hasn't had time to buy the mottoes
yet," said Maggie, "'cause she couldn't
go out this morning; but she is going now and
says we are to go with her. Don't you want
to come too, Belle?"</p>

<p>Belle was only too glad; and as soon as
Mrs. Bradford was ready, the three little girls,
Maggie, Bessie, and Belle, set forth with her
to make the important purchase.</p>

<p>As they were on their way to the store,
Maggie, who had skipped ahead to a corner
they had to turn, came running back with
face all aglow and eyes full of excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh! mamma!" she said: "there's such
a fuss round the corner, and I'm afraid we'll
have to pass it."</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?" asked Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know; but there's a crowd, and I
saw a carriage, and a policeman; and there's
such a fuss."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bessie, who held the most
unbounded faith in policemen, "if there's a
policeman, I s'pose he'll fix it all right: won't
he?"</p>

<p>"But you see we'll have to pass it to reach
the candy-store," said Maggie; "and maybe,
it's a drunken man, or a carry-on horse, or an
animal escaped out of the menagerie, or a
mad dog, or some other dreadful excitement;"
and she looked quite distressed as she finished
the list of horrors she had imagined.</p>

<p>"I think I can take care of you," said her
mother; "and if there should be any danger
we will stop in at grandmamma's till it is
over."</p>

<p>Thus consoled, but still clinging tight to
her mother's hand, Maggie thought they
might venture to go on; but as soon as the
corner was turned, it became quite plain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
there was no danger for them, though there
was indeed what she called "a fuss."</p>

<p>In the middle of the street was a carriage
about which a crowd had gathered, one of the
horses having stumbled, fallen, and broken his
leg. On the sidewalk stood a lady in deep
mourning, with a nurse, and a child about
Bessie's age, the latter screaming at the top
of her voice, and dancing up and down, seemingly
partly in fear, partly in anger; for she
would not listen to her mother and nurse
when they tried to soothe her, but struck out
her hands passionately at the woman when
she tried to draw her away from her mother's
side, so that the lady might find opportunity
to speak to those about her.</p>

<p>"Oh! the poor little girl! just see how
frightened she is," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"I am afraid she is a little naughty, too,"
said her mother, as the child gave another
furious scream and stamped wildly with both
her feet upon the pavement; while the lady,
who was plainly weak and nervous, drew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
hand across her forehead as if the uproar her
little daughter was making was almost too
much for her.</p>

<p>"But I must speak to the lady and see if
I can do any thing for her," continued Mrs.
Bradford; and stepping up to her, as she stood
a little withdrawn from the crowd, she said
kindly, "Can I be of any assistance to you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said the lady: "I am
not ill, only startled; and&mdash;if Mabel would
but be quiet and let me speak and think."</p>

<p>Mabel seemed inclined to do this now that
she had caught sight of the other children;
for ceasing her loud screams, and standing
still, she stared open-mouthed at them.</p>

<p>"My house is but a few steps farther on: will
you not come in and rest, and compose yourself?"
asked Mrs. Bradford of the stranger.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she answered again: "I
believe we have but little farther to go. Is
not the <span class="locked">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Hotel near here?"</p>

<p>"Only a block or two," replied Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we will walk on," said the lady;
and directing the nurse to bring some shawls
from the carriage, she thanked Mrs. Bradford
for her kindness, and taking the hand of her
little girl would have gone on.</p>

<p>But this did not please the child, who now
drawing sharply back from her mother, said
<span class="locked">pettishly,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No: I want to go to that lady's house and
play with those nice little girls."</p>

<p>"But we're not going home. We are going
to the candy-store to buy some mottoes," said
Belle.</p>

<p>When Mabel heard this, she said she wanted
to go to the candy-store and buy mottoes too;
and her mother, who, it was plainly to be seen,
gave way to her in every thing, said she might
do so.</p>

<p>"But if I go and buy you mottoes, will you
be a good girl, and come with me to find your
uncle and little cousin?" asked the stranger
lady.</p>

<p>Mabel promised, anxious now only to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the mottoes; and she and her mother and
nurse followed Mrs. Bradford and our little
friends to the candy-store.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford politely waited and let the
saleswoman attend to the stranger first, for
she saw there would be small chance of peace
till the spoiled child had all she desired.</p>

<p>All she desired! There seemed no end to
that. Not only Maggie and Bessie, but Belle
also, who was accustomed to the most unbounded
indulgence, and to have every wish
gratified, stood amazed at the number and
quantity of dainties which Mabel demanded,
and which she was allowed to have. Parcel
after parcel was put up for her, till not only
her own hands and those of her already well-laden
nurse were filled to overflowing, but
those of her mother also.</p>

<p>"Now do come, dear," said the latter, when
it was impossible that any one of the three
could carry another thing: "let us go and see
the little cousin, and she shall share them
with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, she shan't," whined Mabel: "I don't
want little cousin, and I shan't have her
now."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, then. She is such a
nervous child," said her mother, turning to
Mrs. Bradford. "She shall not tease you if
you do not choose. Come, darling, won't
you, with poor mamma?"</p>

<p>But it took so much more promising and
coaxing before the unruly child could be persuaded
by her weary but foolish mother to go
on, that Mrs. Bradford made her purchases
and quitted the store with her own little flock,
leaving Mabel still whining and fretting, and
at the last moment insisting upon having a
sugar "Temple of Liberty," which the shopwoman
told her was not for sale, but only put
there for show.</p>

<p>"That's the spoildest child I ever saw,"
said Belle, as they turned homewards, each
little girl by her own desire laden with a
parcel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie: "she's just the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of a child to cry for the moon, and get it too,
if she could; but she couldn't. I'm glad,"
she added, with an air of deep wisdom, "that
our parents saw the error of their ways and
didn't train us up that way. What are you
laughing at, mamma?"</p>

<p>But mamma made no answer; the reason
of which Maggie took to be that just at that
moment she bowed to a gentleman who was
passing; and before she could repeat her question
Bessie spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm glad enough I'm not her little cousin
she is going to see. I'm sorry for her cousin."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Belle. "I wouldn't have
such a cousin as Mabel for any thing. She's
too horrid."</p>

<p>"You have a cousin named Mabel, though,
haven't you?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"Yes, so I have; but then she's not one bit
like that Mabel, you know," answered Belle.</p>

<p>"You never saw her, did you?" asked
Bessie.</p>

<p>"No, 'cause she lives about a million thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of miles off, way off in Boston; but she
is coming to see me some time," said Belle.</p>

<p>"But if you never saw her, how can you
tell she is not one bit like that child?" asked
Bessie.</p>

<p>"Why how could she be?" demanded
Belle, indignantly: "her mamma is my papa's
own sister, and he'd never have such a foolish
lady as that for his sister. I guess he
wouldn't;" and Belle shook her head in a
manner which seemed to say that such an
idea was to be put out of the question at
once.</p>

<p>"Yes: you know 'birds of a feather flock
together,'" said Maggie.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"Why," answered Maggie, slowly, as she
considered how she might make one of her
favorite proverbs fit the occasion, "it means&mdash;well&mdash;it
means&mdash;that a foolish mother is
apt to have a foolish child, and things of that
kind. Do you understand, Bessie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Bessie, looking at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sister with admiring pride: "you always
make every thing plain to understand, Maggie.
Don't she, Belle?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Belle: "she's an excellent explainer.
And, Maggie, do you know I told
papa what nice things you said about being
sunbeams, and told him those verses you
made; and, oh! didn't he think it was
splendid?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe Mabel is much of a sunbeam
to her people," said Bessie. "I'm 'fraid
her mother don't teach her to be."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I guess she isn't!" said Belle;
"and I wouldn't want to be a sunbeam to
her."</p>

<p>"But our Father in Heaven makes His sun
to shine on the evil and on the good," said
Mrs. Bradford, softly. "Does not my little
Belle want to copy Him?"</p>

<p>Just the words her father had used yesterday
when she was talking with him on this
very subject. They set Belle thinking; and
she walked more quietly on towards the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
trying to make up her mind if she could "be
a sunbeam" to such a disagreeable child as
the one she had just seen.</p>

<p>She had not quite decided when they reached
Mrs. Bradford's door, and there for the time
her thoughts were taken up with her play and
playmates.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bradford was rather amused when,
one of the dolls being supposed to have behaved
badly, Belle was overheard to <span class="locked">say,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"This child must be punished severely, she
is so very nervous."</p>

<i>AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-040.png" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">The "public rejoicing" had not nearly
come to an end, when, at a much
earlier hour than she was accustomed
to go home, Belle saw Daphne entering the
play-room. Daphne's turbaned head was
thrown back, and her lips pursed up in a
manner which showed Belle that she was not
pleased with something or some one. But
whatever might be the cause of the old nurse's
displeasure, Belle knew well enough that it
would never be visited on her; and Daphne's
appearance just at the moment when she was
so delightfully engaged did not suit her at
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't come to take me home
a'ready?" she said.</p>

<p>"But I has, honey: more's de shame,"
said Daphne, with a look of mingled pity and
affection at her little mistress, while a chorus
of exclamations arose from all the children.</p>

<p>"I shan't go, now! It's too early," said
Belle. "Why, it isn't near dark, Daphne.
Did papa send you?"</p>

<p>"S'pose he tinks he did," replied Daphne;
"but I specs dere's a new missis come to
han', what tinks she's goin' to turn de worl'
upside down. 'Pears like it."</p>

<p>"What?" said Belle, not understanding
such mysterious hints, yet seeing something
was wrong; and Mrs. Bradford asked, "What
are you talking about, Daphne?"</p>

<p>"I'se been bidden to hol' my tongue, and
I neber talks if I ain't got leave," answered
Daphne, with another toss of her turban and
several displeased sniffs.</p>

<p>"But you're talking now, only we don't
know what it's about," said Bessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>To this Daphne made no answer, except by
closing her eyes in a resigned manner, and
giving a sigh which seemed to come from her
very shoes.</p>

<p>"I shan't go home, anyhow," said Belle:
"the party isn't near out."</p>

<p>"Not when papa wants you, dear?" said
Mrs. Bradford, gently.</p>

<p>Belle gave a sigh which sounded like the
echo of Daphne's; but she made no farther
objection when her nurse brought her hat and
prepared to put it on. Daphne clapped on
the hat, giving a snap to the elastic which
fastened it that really hurt the child, though
she was far from intending to do so. Then
she seized her in both arms and gave her a
loud, sounding kiss.</p>

<p>"You just 'member you allus got yer ole
mammy, whatever else you loses, my honey,"
she said. By this time not only little Belle
and the other children, but Mrs. Bradford also,
thought something dreadful must have happened;
although the latter did know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Daphne was sometimes foolish, and very apt
to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Where's my papa?"
said Belle, in a frightened tone. "Is he
lost?"</p>

<p>"He's safe to de hotel, dear," said Daphne.
She never condescended to say home:
"home" was far away, down on the dear
old Georgia plantation. "He's safe to de
hotel; that is, if somebody ain't worrit de
eyes out his head or de head off his shoulders.
You come along, Miss Belle, 'fore all yer
tings is gone to rack an' ruin."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Daphne?" said Mrs.
Bradford.</p>

<p>"I telled yer, missis, I ain't got leave for
talk; an' I neber breaks orders, no way. But
I'se been forgetten: dere's a letter what Massa
Powers send you;" and diving into the
depths of her enormous pocket, Daphne produced
a note which she handed to Mrs. Bradford.
The lady opened and read it; while
Belle watched her, fearing some evil. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Mrs. Bradford smiled and looked rather
pleased, and said to <span class="locked">Belle,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It is all right, darling: run home now;
papa has a great pleasure for you."</p>

<p>It would be impossible to express the length
and depth of the sniff with which Daphne
heard this; but Belle did not notice it, and
was now rather in haste to say good-by and
to go to her papa.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say any thing more if I were
you, Daphne," said Mrs. Bradford, following
them out to the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Dear! I ain't said nothin', Missis," said
Daphne: "didn't her pa forbid it? on'y some
folks is so blin'."</p>

<p>"Who's blind? Not papa?" said Belle.</p>

<p>"It am a kin' of sperit blin'ness I'se speakin'
ob, honey," said Daphne. "Talk ob
spilin' chillen, indeed! Dere's some what's
so bad by natur', you couldn't make 'em no
wuss if you tried all de days ob yer life."</p>

<p>With which she disappeared, banging the
front door after Belle and herself with a force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which told that she was anxious for some
object on which she might safely vent her displeasure.</p>

<p>Belle talked and questioned all the way
home, but received for answer only the same
mysterious and alarming hints; till the child
hardly knew whether to believe that something
dreadful had taken place, or that she
was going home to the promised pleasure.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Belle," said the foolish old
woman, as they crossed the hall on which Mr.
Powers' rooms opened, "you min' I ain't goin'
for let you be snubbed and kep' under. You
come and tell yer ole mammy ebery ting;
an' I'll fight yer battles, if de French nusses
is got sich fly-a-way caps on der heads."</p>

<p>So she opened the door of their own parlor;
and Belle, feeling a little worried and a little
cross at the interruption to her afternoon's
pleasure, passed in.</p>

<p>What did she see?</p>

<p>Upon the sofa, beside her papa, sat a lady
dressed in deep mourning; and upon his knee&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it possible?&mdash;yes, upon papa's knee,
in her own proper place, was a little girl, quite
at her ease, and sitting as if she had a right
and belonged there. And&mdash;could it be?&mdash;Belle
took a second look&mdash;it really <em>was</em> the
child who had been so naughty and shown
herself so spoiled. She stood for a moment
near the door, utterly amazed, and speechless
with displeasure.</p>

<p>Now Belle was what is called a generous
child; that is, she would readily give away
or share what she had with others; but she
was jealous of the affection of those she loved,
especially of her papa's. He was her own,
her very own: all his tenderness and petting
must be for her. She could hardly bear that
he should caress even her beloved Maggie and
Bessie; and if it chanced that he did so, she
would immediately claim a double portion for
herself. She was quick and bright too; and
now she saw in a moment the cause of all
Daphne's mysterious hints and melancholy;
and they helped to increase the angry, jealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
feeling in her own heart. Daphne had feared
that this naughty, contrary child was coming
to interfere with her; and Belle feared it now
herself. Indeed, was it not plain enough
already? There she was on papa's knee, the
seat to which no one but herself had a right;
and papa's arm was about her.</p>

<p>"Come here, my darling: come and speak
to your aunt and little cousin," said Mr.
Powers.</p>

<p>And now Belle spoke, indeed, but without
moving one step forward, and with a very
different tone and manner from those which
her father expected.</p>

<p>"Come off of there!" she said, in a low,
deep tone of intense passion. "Come off of
there! That's my place, he's my papa; you
shan't have him, and I shan't have you.
You're not my cousin; I won't have you, bad,
bad girl!"</p>

<p>She said this with her face perfectly white
with rage, her eyes flashing; and she stood
bolt upright, her two little hands clenched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
stretched downwards on either side. Then
the color came fast and deep, rising to the
very roots of her hair; her lips were drawn,
and her little bosom heaved.</p>

<p>Mr. Powers knew what this meant. Putting
Mabel hastily from his knee, he rose and
walked over to Belle. When Belle was a
baby, and little more than a baby, she had the
naughty habit, when any thing displeased her,
of holding her breath until she was almost
choked and purple in the face. Other children
have this ugly way, which is not only
naughty, but dangerous. But Belle's mamma
had broken her of this when she was very
young; and it was a long, long time since her
father had seen her do it.</p>

<p>But it was coming now, and must be stopped
at once.</p>

<p>"Belle!" he said sharply, and almost sternly,
laying his hand on her shoulder,&mdash;"Belle!"</p>

<p>It did seem hard, but it was necessary, and
was, Mr. Powers knew, the only way to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
his angry little child to her senses. It was
enough. She caught her breath hard, then
gave one or two deep sobs, and burst into a
passion of tears, at the same time turning and
trying to run away.</p>

<p>Poor child! It seemed to her that this
was proof of her jealous fears. Papa had
never spoken so to her before, and it was all
because of that strange child who was coming
in her place. So she thought, and only
wanted to run away out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>But her father caught her, took her up in
his arms, and now spoke to her in the tenderest
tones, covering her wet face with kisses
and trying to soothe her.</p>

<p>Belle knew that she had been naughty, oh!
very naughty; but she still felt very much
injured; and, although after a time her sobs
became less violent, she clung tightly to her
papa, and kept her face hidden on his bosom;
shedding there the tears which brought no
healing with them because they came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
anger and jealousy, and obstinately refusing
to look up or speak to her aunt and cousin.</p>

<p>And yet if Belle had been told but yesterday
that she was soon to see this little cousin,
she would have been delighted. They had
never met before, for Mrs. Walton, Mabel's
mother, had been living abroad for many
years: the little Mabel had been born there,
and there several brothers and sisters had
died. Perhaps this last was one reason,
though it was certainly no good excuse, that
Mabel had been so much indulged.</p>

<p>For some months there had been talk of
their coming home, but their appearance just
at this time was quite unexpected. Young
readers will not be interested in knowing what
brought them: it is enough to say that here
they were, the steamer having brought them
to Boston, whence Mr. Walton had sent on his
wife and child, he staying behind to attend to
some business.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton had thought to give her brother
an agreeable surprise; and so she had, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had been longing to see her, and to have her
help in the training of his motherless little
Belle; but Mrs. Walton and Mabel had not
been with him half an hour before he began to
think that Belle would do quite as well without
the training which Mabel received.</p>

<p>The child had been clamorous to see her
young cousin from the first moment of her
arrival; but Daphne, unwilling to call her
darling from her afternoon's pleasure, had
invented one excuse after another, till Mr.
Powers had insisted that she should bring
Belle.</p>

<p>The jealousy of the old colored nurse, who
was already put out at Mabel's wilful, pettish
behavior, and the way in which she was
allowed to handle and pull about all Belle's
toys and treasures, was immediately aroused
at the idea that her nursling should be made to
yield to the new-comer; and she had shown
this in the manner which had awakened
a like feeling in Belle the moment the child
discovered the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Walton was vexed, as indeed she
might well be, at the reception which Belle
had given to herself and Mabel; but the weak
and foolish mother readily excused or overlooked
in her own child those very faults
which she saw so plainly in her little niece.</p>

<p>At first Mabel had been too much astonished
at Belle's outbreak to do more than stand and
look at her; but when her cousin's cries were
quieted, and she lay still with her face hidden
on her father's shoulder, giving long, heaving
sobs, she began to whine and fret, and to insist
that Belle should be made to come and
play with her, and show her a set of carved
animals, one of Belle's choicest treasures which
Mr. Powers had rescued from her destructive
little fingers.</p>

<p>"My dear brother," said Mrs. Walton, "it
is indeed time that your child was put under
other female management than that of servants.
She is quite spoiled, I see."</p>

<p>Here a prolonged sniff, ending in something
very like a groan, came from near the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
where Daphne still stood: while Belle, feeling
that both she and her devoted nurse had been
insulted, kicked out indignantly with her little
feet.</p>

<p>But her father's hand was on the nestling
head; and he said very quietly, pouring oil on
the wounded <span class="locked">spirits,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"My Belle and her Daphne could not well
do without one another; and Belle is much
less spoiled than she used to be. She is a
pretty good girl now, thanks to the kind teachings
she has had, and her own wish to profit
by them. Mrs. Bradford, the mother of her
little friends Maggie and Bessie, has been very
good to her; so has her teacher, Miss Ashton,
and several other lady friends: so that she
has not been left lately without proper training,
even if her papa and old nurse do indulge
and pet her perhaps a little too much. Belle
and I are all in all to one another now, and
she knows I want her to be a good girl. It is
a long, long time since she has had such a
naughty turn as this, and I know she is sorry
and ashamed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Ashamed Belle certainly was; but I am
afraid she was not sorry, at least not truly
sorry, for she was quite determined not to
look up or speak to her aunt and cousin; and
she nursed the angry feelings in her little
heart, and made up her mind that they were
both quite unbearable.</p>

<p>She was the more sure of this when they
all went together into the dining-room. Belle
was accustomed to go there with her father,
and to eat her simple supper while he dined;
and indulged though she was, she never thought
of fretting or asking for that which he said
was not proper for her; but Mabel called for
every thing that she fancied, and was allowed
to have all manner of rich dainties, her mother
answering when Mr. Powers <span class="locked">interfered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It don't do to refuse her any thing. She is
so nervous and excitable. I have to manage
her the best way I can."</p>

<p>Probably Mr. Powers thought the management
which fell to the share of his motherless
little Belle was better and more profitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
than that bestowed upon Mabel, whose mother
was always with her.</p>

<p>It was the same thing when they went
upstairs again. Mabel wanted to stand in the
gallery above, and look down into the great
hall below, where were lights, and numbers
of people coming and going; and all the pleadings
and promises of her tired mother could
not persuade her to go on to their room,
where the nurse was engaged unpacking.</p>

<p>But her uncle, who was tired of all this wilfulness,
soon put a stop to it, by unclasping
the little hands which held so obstinately to
the banisters, lifting and carrying her to her
mamma's room, where he set her down without
a word.</p>

<p>Mabel was so unused to such firm interference
with her wishes, and was so astonished at
it, that she quite forgot to scream or struggle
till he had gone away and the door was shut
upon her. Then she made up for lost time;
but we will leave her and go with Belle.</p>

<p>Her father saw that she was in no mood for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
advice or reproof; just now either would only
add to her sudden and violent jealousy of her
cousin: so he determined to pass over her
naughtiness for to-night, and hoped that she
would be more reasonable in the morning.
She herself said not a single word about what
had passed, or about her aunt and cousin,&mdash;at
least not to her papa; but when Daphne was
putting her to bed, both the little one and the
old woman found enough to say to one another;
Belle telling her nurse how she had met
Mabel that day and how the latter had behaved;
while Daphne encouraged her to say
as many unkind things as she would, and
made the most of all Mabel's spoiled, troublesome
ways.</p>

<p>Poor little Belle! She could hardly say
her prayers that night, and went to bed feeling
more unhappy than she had done for many
a long day.</p>

<i>SUNLIGHT.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-057.png" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">Things were no better the next morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton did not come down
to breakfast, but Mabel chose to go with her
uncle and cousin. She was in a better humor
than she had been the night before, and would
willingly have made friends with Belle if the
latter would have allowed her to do so. She
was less unruly and wilful at the table also;
for after the way in which her uncle had compelled
her to obey last night, she was a little
afraid of him, and had an idea that he would
not allow her to have her own way in the
manner her papa and mamma did. She did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not like him the less for that though, and when
she asked for one or two things which he did
not think proper for her, submitted quietly
to his refusal, and took what he offered instead.
As for Belle, she not only would not
speak to her cousin beyond the unwilling
"good-morning" which she uttered by her
father's orders, but she would not appear to
be conscious of her presence at all; never
lifting her eyes to her, and if she was forced
to turn her face that way, making a pretence
of looking over Mabel's head or beyond her.
And when they returned to their own parlor,
where Mrs. Walton now sat, Belle gathered
every toy, book, or other trifle that belonged to
her, put them in a closet given for her use,
and with some difficulty turned the key and
took it out; then planted herself with her
back against the door, as if she thought the
lock not enough to keep Mabel's hands from
her treasures, standing there with a look of
the most determined obstinacy and sullenness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Such behavior was not at all like Belle, and
her papa scarcely knew what to make of it.
Even in her most wilful days she had never
shown herself selfish or sulky; and knowing
that she now felt herself aggrieved and injured
by Mabel's presence, and fearing to excite fresh
jealousy, he did not know how to deal with
her.</p>

<p>As for the little girl herself,&mdash;no matter
how much of all this had been caused by old
Daphne,&mdash;Belle knew well that she was very
naughty; but she determined to persist in that
naughtiness so long as Mabel should be there.</p>

<p>To describe Daphne's high-mightiness, not
only with Mabel and the French nurse, but
also with Mrs. Walton, would be impossible.
She carried her turban so straight, and moved
and spoke so stiffly, that she almost awed
even her little mistress; and Mabel was quite
afraid of her. Nor would she give any help
or information to the French woman, pretending
not to understand her English, which,
although broken, was plain enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Dere ain't no use yer talkin' to me," she
said. "I don't unnerstan' yer, nor I ain't goin'
to. I'se allus been fetched up 'mong de Peytons,&mdash;Miss
Belle's mamma she was a Peyton,&mdash;an'
I'se used to fust-rate English; an'
me an' Miss Belle we allus uses it, and neber
can unnerstan' no low talk. 'Sides, I'm deaf
as a post dis mornin' and can't hear no way."</p>

<p>Daphne was troubled with a convenient
kind of deafness, which always came on when
she did not wish to hear a thing.</p>

<p>So Mr. Powers, knowing that both Belle and
Daphne must be brought to their senses and
to better behavior, but not seeing exactly the
way to do it without making matters worse,
betook himself to his good friend Mrs. Bradford
to ask advice.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" he said when he
had finished his story: "if I punish Belle or
reprove Daphne, they are in such a state of
mind that it will give fresh food for jealousy
and bad feeling to both; and yet I cannot let
this go on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Mrs. Bradford; "but
before we try punishment or reproof, let us
see what a little management and kindness
will do. Suppose you send Belle, and, if Mrs.
Walton will allow it, Mabel with her, to spend
the day with my children."</p>

<p>"My sister will allow any thing the child
fancies, I fear," the gentleman answered with
a sigh; "but you do not know what you are
undertaking. A more ungovernable and ungoverned
child than my little niece would be
hard to find; and I fear that neither you nor
your children would pass a pleasant day with
Belle and Mabel here, especially if Belle continues
in her present mood."</p>

<p>"I do not fear that she will," said Mrs.
Bradford. "Maggie and Bessie being of her
own age, and having a great sympathy for her,
may be able to do more in their simple way
to charm the evil spirit than we older people
can. As for Mabel, if she will come, she
will be under some restraint here, as we are
all strangers to her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! you do not know her," said Mr.
Powers. "I was a stranger to her until yesterday,
and yet"&mdash;his look and the shrug of
his shoulders spoke as strongly as the unfinished
sentence could have done.</p>

<p>"Never mind: send her," said the lady.
"I will not let her annoy the other children
or me <em>too</em> much, and I may do her some
good."</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, gratefully: "I know that
you and yours never shrink from doing good
to others because the task may not be an
agreeable one. But do you mean to keep a
house of correction, or, I should say, of good
influences, for all incorrigibly spoiled children?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," said Mrs. Bradford, returning
his smile; "and I believe I have our little
Belle more than Mabel in my mind just now;
but let them both come, and we will see if we
cannot send them back to you this evening in
better and happier moods."</p>

<p>Repeating his thanks, Mr. Powers bade her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
good-by and went home; where he found that
Belle had quitted her stand at the closet-door,
Mabel having gone out. For when the latter
found that she was not to be allowed to have
her cousin's toys, she raised such an uproar as
soon as her uncle was out of the way, that her
mother promised her every thing and any
thing she chose, and had sent her out with the
maid to purchase all manner of playthings.</p>

<p>Belle was glad to hear that she was to go
to the Bradfords'; and even when she learned
that Mabel was to accompany her, she still
felt a satisfaction in it, because she was sure
that the children would sympathize with her,
and be as "offended" with Mabel as she was
herself. She was wild to go at once, without
waiting for her cousin; and her papa consented
that she should do so, hoping that Mrs.
Bradford and the children would bring her to
a better state of feeling before Mabel made
her appearance.</p>

<p>Somewhat to Belle's surprise she found
Bessie rather more ready than Maggie to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
resent her supposed injuries. Bessie did not,
it is true, encourage her in her naughty feelings,
or in returning evil for evil; but she
had been so shocked by Mabel's behavior on
the day before, that she could not wonder at
Belle's dislike. Moreover, Bessie was a little
inclined to jealousy herself; and although she
struggled hard with this feeling, and showed
it but seldom, she was now ready to excuse
it, and find just cause for it, in Belle.</p>

<p>But Maggie was disposed to look at things
in a more reasonable light, and to make the
best of them.</p>

<p>"Why, Belle," she said, cheerily, "I should
think you'd be glad, 'cause now you can be a
sunbeam to your cousin, and try to do her
good."</p>

<p>"I guess I shan't be a sunbeam to her,"
said Belle. "I'd be nothing but an ugly, old
black cloud, what blows a great deal and has
thunder and lightning out of it; and it's just
good enough for her."</p>

<p>And at that moment, indeed, little Belle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
looked much more like a thunder-cloud than
like a sunbeam.</p>

<p>"I just can't bear her. I b'lieve I just hate
her, and I'm going to do it too," she continued.</p>

<p>"But that is naughty," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"I don't care: it is truf," said Belle. "I
can say the truf, can't I?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," answered Bessie, "when it's
the good truth; but if it's a naughty truth, it's
better to keep it in."</p>

<p>"What did Mabel do to you to make you
so mad?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"Why, she&mdash;she"&mdash;and Belle hesitated a
little, rather ashamed of herself now, as she
found how small cause of complaint she really
had&mdash;"why, she took my things when I
didn't say she might. She wanted my carved
animals too, what Uncle Ruthven gave me;
but papa didn't let her have them, and I
wouldn't either. I put them away, and
wouldn't let her look at them,&mdash;no, not one
tiny little peek."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Belle, dear, you don't be selfish with
your things gen'ally," said Bessie. "Why
won't you even let Mabel see them?"</p>

<p>"'Cause she's too spoiled;" said Belle;
"and I b'lieve she'd just go and break them
all up. I don't <em>know</em> she would, but I b'lieve
she would."</p>

<p>"But we oughtn't to b'lieve bad things
about people if we don't know 'em," persisted
Bessie.</p>

<p>"I shan't let her have my things, anyhow,"
replied Belle; "and I'm going to try and have
her put out of the country too."</p>

<p>"How can you?" said Maggie. "They have
a right to stay here if they want to."</p>

<p>"I'll coax papa to write a letter to the
President and ask him to turn out Mabel and
her mamma," said Belle; "and I'm going to
be very excitable and nervous, so he'll do any
thing I want him to."</p>

<p>Maggie had her doubts as to the President's
power in such a matter; but she did not make
them known, thinking it better to try and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
soothe Belle's angry feelings, like the wise
little peacemaker that she was.</p>

<p>"But I think that we ought to be sorry for
your aunt and Mabel, and to have very excusable
feelings towards them," she said.
"You know they have not had so many advantages
as we have, because they have lived
abroad for a good many years; and probably
they have been corrupted by the fashionable
world of Paris."</p>

<p>This was an uncommonly fine speech, even
for Maggie; and Bessie and Belle were struck
quite dumb by it, and for a moment could
do nothing but exchange looks and nods of
admiration and wonder; while Maggie, conscious
that she deserved their approval, not
only for the sentiment, but also for the
manner in which it had been expressed, sat
gazing serenely out of the window as she
received the honors which were due to
her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I s'pose so," said Bessie, with a long
breath, as she recovered a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I s'pose so too," repeated Belle, in a more
amiable tone than she had yet used.</p>

<p>"You see," continued Maggie, thinking it
well to strengthen the good impression she
had made, and speaking with all the solemn
gravity which befitted one who had just uttered
such sublime words,&mdash;"you see we ought
not to be too hard on Mabel, because she is so
very saucy and disobedient to her mother that
I expect she is one of those to whom the
ravens of the valley shall pick out her eye and
the young eagles shall eat it. And, children,
it is plainly to be seen that it is partly her
mother's fault, which is a sad thing, and I fear
she will have to bear the consequences. So
don't you think we ought to be kind to Mabel
and try if we cannot do her some good?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, putting her arm about
Belle's neck; "and, Belle, maybe when Jesus
heard us say we wanted to be sunbeams for
Him, He sent this very disagreeable child to
be your trial, so He could see if you were
quite in earnest about saying it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>This was quite a new view of the subject;
and somehow, Belle scarcely knew how, she
began to feel more kindly towards her aunt
and cousin, and even to have a feeling of pity
for them. But the imaginary "six dirty beggars"
had taken such strong hold of her
mind that she could scarcely resolve all at
once to take in their place this well-dressed,
well-cared-for, but very naughty little cousin.
Mabel could be good and happy if she chose,
and Belle did not see why she should be at
any trouble to make her so, since nothing but
her own wilful humors stood in the way. Still
Maggie's words and those of Bessie had already
had some influence upon her, and
when she next spoke it was in a still milder
tone.</p>

<p>"Why, Bessie," she said, "do you really
think Jesus had Mabel and her mamma come
here just so I could be a sunbeam to them and
try to do them good? I don't believe He
did."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe He didn't send them here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
just for that," answered Bessie; "but when
He did send them, I think He'd like you to
make a little sunshine for them."</p>

<p>"And then," said fanciful Maggie, always
ready to catch at what she thought a poetical
idea,&mdash;"and then, you know, when the sunshine
comes the clouds 'most always go away;
so if we try to be very patient and kind with
Mabel, maybe the clouds of her crossness
and <em>obstinateness</em> will roll away and be seen
no more."</p>

<p>It was impossible to hold out against such
words of wisdom as came from Maggie's
lips; and Belle began to feel that here, after
all, might be the very opportunity she had
wanted.</p>

<p>"And then that would make your aunt
glad," persuaded Bessie; "and we are sorry
for her."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;m&mdash;m, well, I don't know about
that," said Belle: "my aunt said a thing about
me,&mdash;a very disagreeable thing."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"She said I wanted some kind of management.
I forgot what kind. I don't know what
word she called it, but it meant something
horrid I know; and she oughtn't to say I was
spoiled when she spoils her own child."</p>

<p>"No," said Maggie: "people who live in
glass houses oughtn't to throw stones; but I
fear they generally do, for all."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"It means when we do a thing a good deal
ourselves we oughtn't to speak about other
people who do it; but we are apt to."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Belle, taking the maxim
to herself, though Maggie had not meant it
for her, "I s'pose if I used to be spoiled myself,
I oughtn't to talk so much about my
cousin who is."</p>

<p>"But you was never like <em>that</em>," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"I used to be pretty spoiled sometimes,
and yesterday I was&mdash;ugh&mdash;I was horrid,"
answered Belle, a sense of her own past
naughtiness coming over her.</p>

<p>"What did you do?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I screamed and hollered&mdash;and&mdash;and
I kicked. I shouldn't be s'prised if my aunt
thought I was as naughty as Mabel."</p>

<p>"She that repents ought to make haste to
show her repentance," said Maggie. "That
is a new proverb I made up on purpose for
you, Belle, 'cause I thought it suited you."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, Maggie," said Belle:
"then I'll do it."</p>

<p>And so our three little girls resolved that
they would at least meet Mabel kindly and
politely; and as far as possible put the remembrance
of her past ill-behavior from their
minds.</p>

<i>A DAY WITH MAGGIE AND BESSIE.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-073.png" alt="M" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">Mabel herself had some doubts as to
the reception she should meet with
if she went to Mrs. Bradford's; and
when her mother first proposed it, refused to
go. Daphne, who had heard the story from
Belle, had not failed to let Mabel know that
this lady and her little girls were the friends
with whom she had met her cousin yesterday;
and had also drawn a very vivid picture of the
disgust and dislike with which such behavior
as hers was always regarded in their family.</p>

<p>So, as I have said, Mabel at first refused to
go near them; but finding it dull in the hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with only the two nurses for company, as her
mamma and uncle had gone out, she changed
her mind and declared that she would go to
Mrs. Bradford's "to see what it is like, and
only stay just as long as I'm a mind to."</p>

<p>"And yer needn't think you'll disappint
nobody but yerself if yer come away, little
miss," said Daphne, spitefully; for Mabel's
new whim did not please her at all, and she
would much rather she should have kept to her
first decision, and not have bestowed her company
where the old woman thought it little
desired.</p>

<p>However, she did not dare, much as she
would have liked to do so, to refuse to show
Mabel and her nurse the way to Mrs. Bradford's
house; but she revenged herself by
leading them by the longest road and least
pleasant way. But this, however much it
pleased Daphne, did no hurt to Mabel, since
she enjoyed the walk and had no idea of
Daphne's object.</p>

<p>"I'se brought you a Tartar," was the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
colored woman's whispered introduction to
Mrs. Bradford's nurse when they entered the
nursery; and mammy, too, looked askance at
the stranger, who immediately perceived that
she was not too welcome.</p>

<p>But before she had time to turn about
again and say that she would not stay, Maggie
came running from the play-room; and
putting all shyness and prejudice out of mind,
she went up to Mabel, took her by the hand,
and said <span class="locked">kindly,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"We have to feel a little acquainted with
you before we know you, because you are
Belle's cousin; and she is our inseparable.
Come into the play-room. You came so late
it is 'most time for our dinner, but we will
have a good play afterwards."</p>

<p>Such a long, friendly speech to any stranger,
even one of her own age, was a great
effort for Maggie; but for Belle's sake she
wanted to make Mabel comfortable, and put
her on her good behavior at once. And she
succeeded; for the pout passed from Mabel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
lip and the frown from her brow, as she
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Yes, we will; and see what a big box of
sugar-plums I have brought. We'll eat them
all up."</p>

<p>"If mamma gives us leave; but I am quite
sure she will not," said Maggie to herself, and
then said <span class="locked">aloud,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"We might play with them, and you shall
be the store-woman if you like."</p>

<p>"Yes, so we will," said Mabel. "Didn't
Belle try to make you mad at me? She's as
mad as any thing at me herself, and won't
speak to me, when I never did a thing to
her."</p>

<p>"Oh! she's all over that now," said Maggie,
wisely noticing only the last part of
Mabel's speech. "She and Bessie are putting
on the dolls' best suits for you. Come and
see them."</p>

<p>And half-ashamed, half-defiant, Mabel followed
her little hostess into the play-room to
greet Bessie and Belle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>If Mabel was a little shame-faced, Belle was
still more so; for she was not accustomed to
behave in the way she had done that morning,
and her conscience was more tender than Mabel's.
But now that she had resolved to do
better she would not let shame stand in her
way; and going right up to Mabel, she <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Let's kiss and make up, Mabel. I'm
sorry I was so cross this morning."</p>

<p>"And will you let me have your playthings?"
asked Mabel, as she accepted
Belle's offered kiss.</p>

<p>"To look at and play with, but not to
keep," answered Belle. "I'll even let you
have my carved animals&mdash;if you will be careful,"
she added, determined not to stop half
way in her effort to make peace.</p>

<p>And now came mamma, rather expecting to
find the little ones awkward and uncomfortable
together after all that had passed; but
lo! all was peace and sunshine. Her Bessie,
it is true, watched the young stranger with
serious eyes, and had on her <em>disapproving</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
look; for Bessie had been more shocked than
it would be easy to tell by Mabel's misbehavior
of the day before, and found it hard
work to forget it. If Mabel had been some
poor, ragged, neglected child, with no one to
care for her, and many a temptation in her
way, Bessie would have been the first one to
make excuses for her, and to say that nothing
better could be expected from her; but that
any little girl who had loving friends and all
manner of comforts and pleasures about her
should be so perverse and troublesome, seemed
to her out of all reason and hardly to be forgiven.</p>

<p>Still, though she wore her demure little
manner, she was very polite to Mabel, and as
ready as Maggie to show all her dolls and
other treasures. Mabel too, being pleased and
amused, was on her good behavior; and all
was going smoothly.</p>

<p>Before long the children were called to their
dinner. Mabel looked disdainfully at the nice
but simple food which was set before them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and refused this, that, and the other thing,
saying she did "not like them."</p>

<p>"But you will be hungry before you go
home if you do not eat now, my dear," said
Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p>"I'm waiting for something better," said
Mabel; at which piece of rudeness all the
other children, including even little Frankie,
opened their eyes in wonder.</p>

<p>"You will have nothing else except some
plain dessert," said Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p>Mabel pouted, pushed her plate from her,
and kicked with her feet upon the legs of her
chair; but the lady took no notice, although
the three little girls could not help exchanging
looks and biting their lips, to express to
one another their disapproval of such conduct.</p>

<p>But to Frankie, who was blessed with an
uncommonly fine appetite, this refusal to partake
of a good meal seemed a most extraordinary
and unheard-of thing; so, after staring
at her with a pitying look for some moments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and vainly offering her every dainty within his
reach, even to "de nice brown stin off my
sweet potato," he seemed convinced that she
was only naughty, and set about correcting her.</p>

<p>"Did oo ever see Willum what is in 'Slovenly
Peter' boot?" he asked.</p>

<p>The only answer he received was a pettish
shrug of Mabel's shoulders and a fresh kick
upon the chair.</p>

<p>"'Tause he was lite oo, and wouldn't eat
his soup," said Master Frankie, with an air
of stern reproof; "an' oo will be lite him, an'
'when de fif day tame, alas! dey laid oo in
de dround.'"</p>

<p>Which proved too much for the gravity of
his little sisters and Belle, who thought this
extremely funny; and, in spite of Mabel's
scowl, went off into peals of merry laughter.</p>

<p>Mabel hoped and expected that Mrs. Bradford,
seeing she would not eat what was set
before her, would send for some more dainty
and richer food; but she soon found this was
not to be, and that the lady did not even appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to trouble herself because she would not
eat. This was something quite new to Mabel,
who was surprised as well as displeased at
Mrs. Bradford's unconcern.</p>

<p>When the dessert was put upon the table,
there was a plain rice pudding and a small
dish of bright clear jelly.</p>

<p>"I'll take jelly," said Mabel, not waiting
till she was asked, as a polite child would have
done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford quietly helped each child to
a portion of the pudding and some jelly, leaving
but little of the latter in the dish.</p>

<p>Mabel ate up her jelly as fast as possible,
keeping her eye all the while on what remained
in the dish; and as soon as she had
finished her own, thrust out her plate, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"More, please."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford gave it to her without a word;
but Frankie, encouraged by the applause with
which his first reproof had been received,
thought himself called upon for another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Frankie pinned his faith on "Slovenly
Peter;" knew it all by heart, quoted from it
on all occasions, and drew from it lessons and
examples suitable to himself and others.</p>

<p>"Dere's anoder boy named Jatob in 'Slovenly
Peter,'" he said severely: "he was so
dweedy dat he brote hisself in two. I s'pose
you'll be lite him," he added, not at all disturbed
by the want of similarity between the
two unhappy fates he had predicted for Mabel.</p>

<p>And Mabel felt somewhat abashed when she
saw how her greediness had struck this little
boy, who she could not but see behaved far
better than herself.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Bessie, "would you rather
I should not eat the raisins in my pudding?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, darling, I think you had better
not as you were not very well this morning,"
said her mother.</p>

<p>Again Mabel was surprised. She knew
very well that she would have rebelled against
such an order, and had her own way too; but
here was this little girl not only submitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
quietly and cheerfully to what Mabel looked
upon as a hardship, but actually asking if it
was her mother's wish. It was something
quite new to Mabel.</p>

<p>Had Bessie talked to her for an hour about
her greedy, wilful ways, it would not have
done one half the good that the example of her
own simple regard to her mother's wishes did.
And Mabel looked at Bessie, then down upon
her plate, then raised her eyes to Bessie's
again, with some admiration mingled with the
wonder in them; and little Belle, who was
watching her cousin, said to <span class="locked">herself,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Now, I just b'lieve Bessie is a sunbeam,
showing Mabel the right, best way to mind her
mother; but Bessie don't know she did it."</p>

<p>Quite right, little Belle! And it was not
the first ray of light which had fallen that day
upon Mabel's wilful and selfish but not hardened
young spirit. Already was she beginning
to wonder what these children, so
obedient and docile, must think of her, and
to feel ashamed of her conduct before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time past a favorite practice of
the three little girls,&mdash;Maggie, Bessie, and
Belle,&mdash;had been to draw what they called
"proverb-pictures."</p>

<p>This was an invention of Maggie's, and was
considered by the children an unfailing source
not only of amusement, but also of profit.
For all manner of useful hints and gentle moral
lessons were supposed to be conveyed in these
pictures; and if one noticed any thing in the
conduct or speech of another which did not
seem exactly proper, she would make a proverb-picture,
and kindly present it to the short-comer.</p>

<p>At first a proverb had always been taken
as a foundation for these pictures, and Maggie
manufactured a good many for the purpose:
hence their name; but after a while they were
sometimes drawn without reference to any
particular maxim or saying, and suited only
to the need of the moment.</p>

<p>And I am bound to say that they answered
their intended purpose: such hints, if needed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
were always taken in good part and seldom
neglected; indeed, it was considered rather
a treat to receive one, especially from Maggie,
and each little girl treasured those which were
given to her with great care, and frequently
studied them over.</p>

<p>Nor were they considered only as a means
of mild reproof or gentle persuasion to do
right; but many a little incident and scene
of their daily lives were represented, and all
these formed to their thinking a very interesting
collection.</p>

<p>It is true that the pictures generally needed
considerable explanation, not only to other
friends who might be treated to a sight of
them, but also to one another; but this was
really a part of the pleasure, and afforded
great satisfaction to the young artists. That
is, to Belle and Bessie; Maggie was rather
shy about doing this, and preferred to label
her pictures, or to write a short explanation
beneath.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Belle made the best pictures, indeed they
were not bad for a child of her age; and
Maggie and Bessie took much pride in what
they considered her great talent, and encouraged
her to make the most of it, and put it in
constant practice.</p>

<p>So now Maggie bethought herself that it
would be well for Belle to try to do her cousin
some good by means of these "proverb-pictures."
She did not feel intimate enough
with her as yet to try to do so herself, but
she thought that Belle being such a near relation
might very well do it without giving
offence.</p>

<p>When they left the table she drew Belle
aside and whispered to <span class="locked">her:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Belle, wouldn't it be a good plan to try
Mabel with some proverb-pictures, and see if
they will improve her? You know it's a much
agreeabler way of having a good lesson than
being scolded or having people mad with you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Belle: "let's do it now."</p>

<p>"No," said Maggie, "'cause it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
stupid for her while we made the pictures;
besides, I don't think Bessie and I know her
well enough yet, but you might do it when
you go home. I composed two proverbs that
may do her some good, if you like to take
them."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Belle: "tell me 'em, Maggie."</p>

<p>"One is, 'The greedy pig don't get much,
after all,'" said Maggie.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Belle, seeing the beauty
of the application at once, and much struck
with its force.</p>

<p>"And the other," said Maggie, "is, 'All
shun a disagreeable child.'"</p>

<p>"What is shun?" asked Belle.</p>

<p>"To run away," answered Maggie.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Belle, thoughtfully: "those
will make very nice pictures, Maggie. I'll
take 'em. Say 'em again, 'fear I forget;"
and she repeated the new "proverbs" over
several times after Maggie, and for the remainder
of the afternoon her mind was much
occupied with plans for making fine drawings
of them for her cousin's benefit.</p>

<i>PROVERB-PICTURES.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-088.png" alt="F" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">For the rest of the day Mabel behaved
better, on the whole, than the other
children had expected. It is true
that she was well amused, and also that being
a stranger and company, the other little girls
gave way to her, and let her do pretty much
as she pleased. She showed herself rather
selfish, however, taking all their kindness as
a matter of course, and always seizing upon
the best and prettiest things for her own use.</p>

<p>But when it was time to go home, and the
nurses came for Belle and Mabel, there was
much such a scene as had taken place on the
day when Mabel had first been met by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
other children. She positively refused to go
home; and when Mrs. Bradford insisted that
she should obey, was led shrieking and screaming
from the house, fighting with her long-suffering
nurse in a manner which made poor
Belle feel "too 'shamed for any thing to go
in the street with such disrespectable behavior,"
and caused Daphne to declare that she and
Miss Belle had "never been so <em>degraced</em> in
all our born days."</p>

<p>This determined Belle to carry out her plan
of the "proverb-pictures" as soon as possible;
and when her hat was taken off, she immediately
begged her papa for a sheet of fool's-cap
paper and a pencil, and fell to work.</p>

<p>When Mabel saw what she was about, she
wanted to draw also; and her uncle furnished
her with paper and pencil.</p>

<p>"What are you making?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you by and by, when it's all done,"
said Belle, severely. "It's not ready for you
to understand just yet; but it's going to be
a very good lesson for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>However, she suffered Mabel to look over
her paper, and even to copy the figures which
grew beneath her busy fingers; Mabel little
thinking all the while that she herself was
the subject of the pictures. Meantime Mr.
Powers and Mrs. Walton, pleased to see the
children so quiet, and apparently agreeing so
well, talked quietly together.</p>

<p>But this proved too good to last.</p>

<p>"Now they're all done, and I'll tell you
about them; and we'll see if they'll improve
you," said Belle, when she had completed
two pictures. "Do you see these animals?"
and she pointed with her pencil to a curious
collection of four-legged objects, with every
possible variety of tail among them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mabel: "what are they?
Bugs?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Belle, indignantly: "they
are pigs. This is a 'proverb-picture.' Proverbs
are meant to do people good, or give
them a lesson; but Maggie and Bessie and I
think pictures make 'em plainer. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
proverb that Maggie made up. Here is a man
pouring milk into a trough what the pigs eat
out of, and this pig,"&mdash;directing Mabel's
attention to a creature without any legs, those
four members which were supposed to belong
to him lying scattered in all directions over
the picture, while long streaks intended to
represent floods of tears poured from his eyes,&mdash;"and
this pig was so greedy that he ran
as fast as he could to the end of the trough
where he fought the man was going to pour
the milk. But the man fought he'd serve
him right, and so he went to the ofer end and
poured the milk in there; and when the pig
tried to run there, his legs were so tired they
all fell off; so he couldn't get any milk,
and he cried so much he 'most drowned himself.
And the proverb of the picture is, 'The
greedy pig don't get much, after all.' When
pigs or other people are greedy, their legs
gen'ally come off, or other accidents; and if
they don't, people think they're very horrid,
any way. Do you know who the greedy pig
is meant for?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel had a pretty clear idea, and was not
pleased, which was not at all strange; but
her curiosity was excited respecting the other
picture, and she determined to satisfy it before
she made any disturbance.</p>

<p>"What is this picture?" she asked, pouting,
but taking no farther notice of Belle's
question.</p>

<p>In the second sketch a number of square
and triangular bodies, with little, round heads,
and long, sprawling legs and arms, were
grouped together in the wildest confusion at
the two ends of the picture, which extended
the whole length of the sheet. In the middle
was an object supposed to represent a carriage,
the like whereof was never contrived
by any coach-maker upon the face of the
earth; while a horse, in the same condition as
the pig before mentioned,&mdash;namely, with all
his legs broken off,&mdash;lay upon the ground; his
mate, looking much like a chair turned upside
down, standing by, disconsolate. But the
chief interest of the picture was intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lie in the central figure, in which a small child,
with very short skirts and very long limbs,
was represented as dancing wildly about, with
not rivers,&mdash;as in the case of the pig,&mdash;but
cataracts of tears spouting from her eyes.
Two circles, one within the other, stood for
her head; the inner one, nearly as large as
the outer, being her mouth, stretched to its
utmost extent. And lest there should be any
mistake as to the likeness, below this figure
was printed in large, crooked <span class="locked">letters,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>M A B U R L.</i></p>

<p>"That," said Belle, more sternly than before,
"is a picture about another proverb that
Maggie made up on purpose to be of use to
you. The name of it is, 'All scamper away
as fast as they can go from a spoiled child;'
at least, that was what she meant. Here is
the spoiled child, squealing and hollering;
there is a poor horse that broke his leg; and
here are all the people in the street running
away from her. These four are policemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and they were going to take her up; but even
the policemen would not stand her, and ran
away too. Even her mother 'came degusted
at her at last, and left her; so she had not a
single person left. And she had no one to
give her something to eat, and no one to put
her to bed; so she had to sleep in the gutter,
and be starved, and in the morning she was
dead, and all dirty out of the gutter."</p>

<p>"She wasn't either," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"She was too," contradicted Belle.</p>

<p>Mabel made a snatch at the picture, which
Belle as quickly drew from her, so that between
them it was torn in two; and Mabel at
the same moment set up the shriek she always
gave when she was displeased.</p>

<p>Mr. Powers and Mrs. Walton, their conversation
thus suddenly brought to an end,
turned hastily to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>It was a sorry sight that met their eyes.
Belle stood looking at her cousin with a face
which, to do her justice, was only intended
as the expression of outraged and offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
virtue; while Mabel, shrieking with passion,
was frantically tearing to bits the half of the
sheet she had secured.</p>

<p>"What is it, children? What are you quarrelling
about now?" asked both the parents
at once.</p>

<p>Mabel did not, perhaps could not, answer;
but Belle spoke up boldly.</p>

<p>"I'm not quarrelling, papa," she said. "I
was just trying to give Mabel a lesson of what
might happen to her if she didn't behave
herself, and she was mad about it; and she
tore my picture,&mdash;my nice, pretty proverb-picture
that I would have given her if she had
been good and improved herself by it. I know
Maggie and Bessie would think it very interesting
if they saw it, and now I can't show it
to them;" and Belle held up the torn sheet
with a very aggrieved air. "It was only good
intentions, papa; and she went and wouldn't
have 'em," she added, feeling herself almost
equal to Maggie Bradford as she made this
grand speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Even Mrs. Walton could not help smiling
in the midst of her efforts to quiet the screaming
Mabel and lead her from the room.</p>

<p>When they were gone, Mr. Powers took his
little daughter on his knee; but Belle was not
satisfied to see that he looked very grave.
For a moment or two neither spoke, Belle
not knowing exactly what to say, although she
did wish to excuse herself; while her father
seemed to be thinking.</p>

<p>At last he <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"My little girl, how long is this to go on?"</p>

<p>"What, papa?" asked Belle, though she
had a pretty clear idea what he meant.</p>

<p>"This constant quarrelling between you and
your cousin. Your aunt and I are very glad
to see one another again; but all our comfort
is destroyed because you and Mabel disagree
all the time."</p>

<p>Belle looked rather hurt.</p>

<p>"I'm sure, papa," she said, "I have tried
to be good to-day, ever since I went to Maggie's
and Bessie's; and she was a little good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
too, but greedy and selfish. And then she
was in such a passion when we had to come
home, I fought I'd better try to correct her.
And I'm sure I fought proverb-pictures was a
good way to do it, but they just made her
mad. I s'pose I might have known it," she
added, with a sigh: "she is so very bad and
spoiled that things that do other children
good only make her worse. See, papa, if this
wasn't a nice lesson for her;" and spreading
out the half of the sheet which she held,
Belle explained to her papa the portion of her
picture which still remained.</p>

<p>Certainly, Mr. Powers did not find the likeness
to Mabel very flattering, or think it calculated
to put her in a good humor with herself
or the little artist. Nevertheless, he smiled a
little, which encouraged Belle, and she went
<span class="locked">on:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I know that child must come to a bad
end," she said; "and I shall never try again
to be friends with her, or to do her good,&mdash;no,
never, never!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the little girl that wanted to be a
sunbeam and shine for Jesus, and show others
the way to Him?" asked her father.</p>

<p>Belle hung her head.</p>

<p>"But, papa," she said presently, "you see
it's no use with her. I b'lieve she's the wickedest
girl that ever lived, and I don't believe
there's any thing bad she wouldn't do if she
had a chance. She took Baby Annie's chair
to-day; and when baby didn't know any
better, and cried for it, Mabel wouldn't give it
to her. I think I'll just make up my mind to
leave her be all the rest of her life, and make
b'lieve she isn't my cousin. I wish she stayed
to Boston or else to Europe."</p>

<p>"For He maketh His sun to rise on the
evil and on the good," said Mr. Powers,
softly.</p>

<p>Belle gave another long, despairing sigh,
and laid her head back against her father's
shoulder; but she made no more attempt to
excuse herself or to blame her cousin.</p>

<p>"I will not say that you had not some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
thought of doing good to Mabel," said Mr.
Powers; "but you began wrong, Belle. I
think you did not have very kind feelings in
your heart, and that you looked only at what
was naughty and perverse in her; and so your
picture was not pleasant, and only made her
angry. You and Maggie and Bessie understand
and love one another, and so you take
it pleasantly and patiently when one among
you tries this way of helping another in what
is right. But I hardly think that any one of
you three, good friends as you are, would have
been very much pleased to have had such a
picture made of you."</p>

<p>Belle sat thoughtful a moment, and then
<span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Well, no, papa, I don't b'lieve I would
have liked it, if Maggie or Bessie had made
a proverb-picture about me slapping Daphne,
or being in a passion, or doing any of those
very naughty things I used to do so much.
But, papa, don't you think my patience about
Mabel must be 'most used up?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here," said Mr. Powers, drawing toward
him a large Bible which lay near, and
turning over the leaves till he found the words
he wanted,&mdash;"see here, dear, listen to these
words: 'Charity suffereth long and is kind,
is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, beareth
all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
things.' I am afraid my little Belle has not
that kind of charity towards her cousin."</p>

<p>"Charity, papa?" said Belle: "charity
means giving money and things to beggars
and poor people, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Charity here means love," said Mr.
Powers,&mdash;"love to God and to man, that love
which makes us want to work for Jesus by
being gentle and patient with the faults of
others; which will not let us be made angry
by little things; which is not ready to think
harm of our friends and playmates; love which
believes and hopes that even those who are
very wrong and naughty may be made better,
and which teaches us to take the pleasantest
way of doing this, not showing others their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
faults in a manner to pain or anger them, but
trying to show them the better way by an
example of kindness and gentleness."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;m&mdash;m, no, papa," said Belle,
thoughtfully, when her father ceased speaking:
"I don't think I have much of that kind
of love-charity to Mabel,&mdash;no, I don't b'lieve
I have."</p>

<p>"I fear not," said her papa; "but will you
not try for it, my darling?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; "but you couldn't
s'pect it would come very quick, papa. You
see I don't know Mabel very well yet, and I
guess I don't care 'bout knowing her any
more than I do now. She's so very, very
spoiled, and I b'lieve she'll never be any
better."</p>

<p>"'Charity believeth all things, hopeth all
things,'" said Mr. Powers.</p>

<p>"Is that in the Bible Proverbs?" asked
Belle.</p>

<p>"No, it is not in Proverbs; but I can give
you a verse from Proverbs which may help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
you: 'A soft answer turneth away wrath.'
Wrath means anger."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Belle: "I found that out;
because to-day, when Mabel spoke very angry
and cross, Bessie answered her very pleasant
and nice; and Mabel looked at her just as if
she didn't know what to make of her; and
then she spoke nicely too, and quite behaved
herself. I s'pose Bessie has love-charity for
Mabel. Tell me those words again, papa. I'll
learn a little bit of 'em every day till I know
'em all, and try to do 'em too."</p>

<p>Her father did as she asked; and then, for
it was growing late, sent her away to bed, satisfied
that his lesson was taking root, and that
Belle was sorry&mdash;though she did not say so&mdash;that
she had offended Mabel by her "proverb-picture."</p>

<p>He would have been still more sure of this,
and well pleased too, had he heard his little
girl when Daphne was undressing her, and as
usual began to talk of Mabel in a very uncomplimentary
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Daffy," said Belle, "I guess we'll have
some charity for Mabel, not beggar-charity,
but love-charity, that 'b'lieveth all things,
hopeth all things,' and makes up its mind
maybe she will learn better, and be good,
after all."</p>

<i>MABEL'S NEW WHIM.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-104.png" alt="&quot;P" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">"Please give me my puf-folio,
Daphne," were Belle's first words
in the morning before she was up.</p>

<p>"Puf-folio" stood for port-folio in Belle's
English; and the one in question was greatly
prized by her, as were also the contents. It
had been given to her by Harry Bradford, who
had also presented one to each of his little
sisters; and was formed of large sheets of
pasteboard, bound and tied together with
bright-colored ribbons; Belle's with red,
Bessie's with blue, and Maggie's with purple.
To be sure, the binding and sewing had all
been done by Aunt Annie; but the materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
had been furnished from Harry's pocket-money,
and the portfolios were regarded as
the most princely gifts, and treasured with
great care.</p>

<p>Within were "proverb-pictures" of every
variety and in great number, also many a
scrap of paper, and&mdash;treasure beyond price!&mdash;whole
sheets of fool's-cap for future use.</p>

<p>One of these last Belle drew forth, and sitting
up in her bed began to compose another
picture. She was busy with it till Daphne
took her up; and even while the old woman
was dressing her she kept making little
rushes at it, putting in a touch here and there
till she had it finished to her satisfaction.</p>

<p>Mabel did not come to breakfast with her
uncle and cousin that morning, but chose to
take it with her mamma in her own room.</p>

<p>So little Belle, when the meal was over,
asked her papa if she might go to her cousin.</p>

<p>"No, dear, I think not," said her father.
"You and Mabel are better apart."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, papa!" said Belle; "for I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
going to have love-charity for Mabel, and ask
her to have some for me, 'cause maybe I
need a little too. I want to make up with
her; and here's a new picture for her that I
b'lieve she will like better than that old,
naughty one I oughtn't to have made last
night. Can't I go and be friends?"</p>

<p>Her father examined the picture, to make
sure that it could give no cause for new
offence; and, satisfied with her explanation,
allowed her to go with it to Mrs. Walton's
room.</p>

<p>Belle knocked, and being told to come in,
obeyed. Her aunt was on the couch, Mabel
beside her playing with a doll, and the scowl
and pout with which the latter greeted her
cousin were not very encouraging.</p>

<p>But Belle, feeling that she had been wrong
herself, was determined to persevere in "making
up" with Mabel; and she said, though
rather <span class="locked">timidly,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I made you another proverb-picture,
Mabel, <span class="locked">and"&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no," said Mrs. Walton before she
had time to finish her speech: "we have had
trouble enough with your 'proverb-pictures,'
Belle: you and Mabel cannot agree, it seems;
and you had better each keep to your own
rooms."</p>

<p>Belle was very much hurt, although she
felt this was partly her own fault; and she
turned to go with the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Walton saw she was grieved,
she was sorry for what she had said; and she
called to the <span class="locked">child,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Come here then, Belle: I want to speak
to you."</p>

<p>Belle hesitated a moment, holding the doorknob,
and twisting it back and forth; but at
last she ran over to Mrs. Walton's side, and
put her hand in that which was held out to
her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I teased Mabel, Aunt Fanny,"
she said; "and I didn't make this picture
for a lesson to her, but for a lesson to myself,
and to let her see I did want to make up. It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
'most all about me doing things I ought to
Mabel; and I'm going to try to have love-charity,
and do 'em."</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Mabel, slipping off the
couch and coming to her cousin's side, curiosity
getting the better of her resentment.</p>

<p>Belle spread out her picture, and explained
all its beauties to Mabel.</p>

<p>"That's me, with ugly, naughty lips like I
had yesterday, making you," she said; "and
I oughtn't to do it when I am often very
spoiled myself."</p>

<p>"No," said Mabel, gazing with rapt interest
upon the drawing, and already considerably
mollified by finding that Belle put her own
failings also in her "proverb-pictures."</p>

<p>"But I don't mean to do it any more, Mabel;
but just to try to make you be good and love
me by living good my own self. And now
there's you and me: me letting you have my
carved animals, and not being mad even if you
broke one a little bit; but you wouldn't if
you could help it, would you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed, I wouldn't," said Mabel, very
graciously: "let's be friends again, Belle."</p>

<p>So the quarrel was once again made up,
and this time with more good will on both
sides.</p>

<p>"You are a dear child," said Mrs. Walton,
and she looked thoughtfully and lovingly at
the warm-hearted little girl, who, when she
knew she had been wrong, was ready to
acknowledge it, and to try to make amends;
"and Mabel and I should have been more patient
with you in the beginning. Poor child!
It was a sad thing for you to lose your mother
so early."</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't <em>lose</em> her," said Belle,
looking up in her aunt's face with eyes of
innocent surprise.</p>

<p>"How, dear! What do you mean?" asked
Mrs. Walton, wondering in her turn. "Your
mamma has gone away from you."</p>

<p>"Yes, but she went to Jesus," answered the
child, simply. "You don't lose something
when you know it is in a very safe, happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
place with some one very dear and good to
take care of it, even if you can't see it any
more: do you, Aunt Fanny?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," said Mrs. Walton.</p>

<p>"Well, you know mamma has gone to
heaven to stay with Jesus, and He's taking
care of her; and by and by papa and I will
go there too, and then we'll see her again; so
we didn't <em>lose</em> her, you know. But then I
have to be very good and try to please Jesus,
and mind what He says; and so I know He
wants me to have love-charity for Mabel, and
try to not care very much if she does things
I don't like. And mamma will be glad too.
Oh, no, Aunt Fanny! I didn't lose my dear
mamma: I know where she is, all safe."</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton drew her to her and kissed
her; while Mabel, wondering at the new softness
and sweetness in Belle's face and voice,
had forgotten the picture and stood looking at
her.</p>

<p>"All safe!"</p>

<p>Five little graves lay side by side in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
English churchyard far away; and of those
who rested beneath, the mother had always
spoken as her "lost darlings." She never
called them so again; for were they not "all
safe"? Others had told her the same, others
had tried to bring comfort to her grieving and
rebellious heart; but from none had it come
with such simple, unquestioning faith as from
the innocent lips of the unconscious little one
before her. Her own loved ones, as well as
Belle's dear mother, were not lost, but
"all safe."</p>

<p>She kissed the child again, this time with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You see," continued Belle, encouraged to
fresh confidence by the new kindness of her
aunt's manner,&mdash;"you see, Aunt Fanny, that
makes another reason for me to try to be
good. I have a good many reasons to please
Jesus; 'cause dear mamma in heaven would
want me to be good, and I would like to do
what she wants me to, even more when she
is away than if she was here; and 'cause I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
have to be papa's little comfort. That's
what he always says I am, and he says I am
his sunbeam too."</p>

<p>"I think I must call you that too, darling.
You have brought a little ray of sunshine here
this morning."</p>

<p>"Maggie says when we're good it's always
like sunshine, but when we're naughty it's
like ugly, dark clouds," said Belle. "I'm
sorry I was a cloud yes'day, and that other
day, Aunt Fanny. But I b'lieve it's time for
me to go to school now."</p>

<p>"Do you like school?" asked Mrs. Walton.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess I do!" said Belle. "Why, you
don't know what nice times we have! and
Miss Ashton is so kind."</p>

<p>"I want to go to school too," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Not this morning, dear," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall,&mdash;I shall too, now! If Belle
goes, I will. I shan't stay here with nobody
to play with me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton coaxed and promised, but all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to no purpose. Mabel was determined to
see for herself the "nice times" which Belle
described: school suddenly put on great
attractions for her, and nothing would do
but that she must go at once. So, taking her
by the hand, Mrs. Walton followed Belle to
Mr. Powers' parlor, and asked him what he
thought of Mabel's new whim.</p>

<p>Now, to tell the truth, Mr. Powers had
believed that the best possible thing for Mabel
would be to go to school, and be under the firm
but gentle rule of Miss Ashton; but he had
not yet proposed it to her mother, knowing
that the mere mention of it from another
person would be quite enough to make the
froward child declare she would never go.
Therefore he thought well of Mabel's wish,
although he was not prepared to take Miss
Ashton by surprise on this very morning.</p>

<p>But he knew there was one vacancy in her
little school, and that she would probably
consent to let Mabel fill it; and he thought
it was best to take advantage of the little girl's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sudden fancy, or, as Maggie Bradford would
have said, to "strike while the iron was
hot."</p>

<p>Accordingly he told his sister that he would
himself walk to school with the two children,
and learn what Miss Ashton had to say on the
matter; and Mabel, being made ready with all
speed, set forth with her uncle and cousin.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton agreed to take the new-comer;
and Mabel was at once put into the seat formerly
occupied by Bessie Bradford. Maggie
and Bessie had belonged to Miss Ashton's
class; but their mother taught them at home
now.</p>

<p>Belle could not help a little sigh and one or
two longing thoughts as she remembered her
dear Bessie who had formerly sat beside her
there, but she did not say a word of her regret
to Mabel.</p>

<p>Mabel behaved as well as possible during
the whole of school-time; whether it was that
she was well amused, or that she was somewhat
awed by the novelty of the scene, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
all the new faces about her, certainly neither
Miss Ashton nor Belle had the least cause of
complaint against her when the time came
for school to be dismissed.</p>

<p>And this good mood continued all that day,
with one or two small exceptions. It is true
that on more than one of these occasions
there might have been serious trouble between
the little cousins, but for Belle's persevering
good-humor and patience; and she would
have thought herself "pretty naughty," if she
had behaved as Mabel did. But she excused
and bore with her, because it was Mabel for
whom she was to have that charity which
"suffereth long and is kind."</p>

<p>It was hard work too for little Belle; for,
though naturally more generous and amiable
than her cousin, she was pretty much accustomed
to having her own way in all things
reasonable. At home her every wish was law
with her papa and nurse; Maggie and Bessie
Bradford could not do enough to show their
love and sympathy; and all her young playfellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and school-mates followed their example,
and petted and gave way to her "because
she had no mother." So "giving up" was
rather a new thing for Belle, not because she
was selfish, but because she was seldom called
upon to do it.</p>

<p>However, she had her reward; for, thanks
to her own sweetness and good temper, there
was peace and sunshine throughout the day.
She saw that her father and aunt were pleased
with her; and once even Mabel, seeming
touched and ashamed when Belle had quietly
yielded her own rights, turned around in a
sudden and unwonted fit of penitence, and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"There, take it, Belle: you had the best
right; and I won't be mean to you again,
'cause you're real good to me."</p>

<p>"My darling has been such a good girl to-day!"
said Mr. Powers, as he took her on his
knee when they were alone, and she came for
the little talk they generally had before her
bed-time: "she has been trying to practise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the lesson she learned last night, and so has
made all about her happy."</p>

<p>"And been a little sunbeam, papa, have
I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, love,&mdash;a true sunbeam."</p>

<p>"And did I make you pleased, papa?"</p>

<p>"Very much pleased, and truly happy,
dear."</p>

<p>"And mamma will be pleased too, papa;
and mamma's Jesus; and it makes Him my
Jesus when I try to be His sunbeam and shine
for Him, don't it? I guess everybody would
be a sunbeam if they always had 'love-charity.'
Tell me it over again, papa, so I will
remember it very well, and s'plain to me a
little more about it."</p>

<i>THE LOCKET.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-118.png" alt="A" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">And this really proved the beginning
of better things for Mabel. Not that
she improved so much all at once, or
that she was not often selfish, perverse, and
disobedient; or that she did not often try
little Belle very much, and make it hard for
her to keep her resolution of being kind and
patient. Nor must it be supposed that Belle
always kept to this resolution, or that she and
Mabel did not now and then have some pretty
sharp quarrels; still, on the whole, they agreed
better than had seemed probable on their first
meeting.</p>

<p>And perhaps it was good for Belle, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
as for Mabel, that she should sometimes be
obliged to give up her own will to another;
and there was no fear, while her papa and old
Daphne were there to watch over her interests,
that she would be suffered to be too much imposed
upon.</p>

<p>But there could be no doubt that Mabel was
less unruly and exacting. It might be that
she was really happier with a companion of
her own age, or that she was shamed by
Belle's example and kindness to her, or perhaps
it was both these causes; but day by
day Belle found it easier to be on good terms
with her, and the two children were really
growing fond of one another.</p>

<p>Other things which had a good effect on
Mabel were going to school and being now and
then with Maggie and Bessie. She could not
but see how much happier and lovelier were
those children who were obedient, gentle, and
kind; and she learned much that was good
without any direct teaching. And even the
"proverb-pictures" became to her what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
were intended to be to all, a source of improvement;
for Maggie understood better
than Belle the art of "giving a lesson" without
wounding the feelings; and many a gentle
reproof or wise hint was conveyed to Mabel
by means of these moral sketches, in which
she really took a great interest.</p>

<p>After the first novelty of school had worn
off, Mabel tired of the restraint and declared
that she would go no more; but in the mean
time her father had arrived, and he insisted
that she should keep on.</p>

<p>For some days after this she gave Miss
Ashton a good deal of trouble, and set at defiance
many of her rules and regulations;
but she soon found that this did her no service,
for Miss Ashton, gentle as she was,
would be obeyed; and Mabel did not find the
solitude of the cloak-room agreeable when she
was punished by being sent there, and concluded
that, "after all, she had the best time
when she was good."</p>

<p>She was not at all a favorite with her school-mates,&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fractious and self-willed little
child; and Belle had to "take her part" and
coax a good deal before she could persuade
them to regard her with any patience, or to
feel willing to accept her as a member of their
circle.</p>

<p>"What have you there?" asked Mabel one
day, coming into Belle's nursery and finding
her looking lovingly at some small object she
held in her hand.</p>

<p>"It's my locket,&mdash;my new locket that
papa gave me a few minutes ago," answered
Belle.</p>

<p>"Let's see it," said Mabel, making a grasp
at it; but Belle was too quick for her, and
would not suffer her to seize her treasure.</p>

<div><img src="images/i-123.png" class="figcenterfull" alt="Illustration of the above" />
</div>

<p>"You can't have it in your own hands,"
she said; "for it was my own mamma's, and I
don't want any one to touch it, 'cept they
loved her. Only Maggie and Bessie," she
added, remembering that they had never known
her mother, but that she would by no means
keep the choicest of her treasures from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
hands, feeling sure as she did that they would
guard what was precious to her with as much
care as she would herself.</p>

<p>"I'll show it to you, Mabel. Isn't it pretty?"
and Belle held up a small locket on a
slight gold chain.</p>

<p>It was a little, old-fashioned thing, heart-shaped,
and made of fretted gold with a forget-me-not
of turquoises in the centre. It
was very pretty,&mdash;in Belle's eyes, of the most
perfect beauty; but its great value lay in that
it had belonged, as she told Mabel, to her own
mamma when she was a girl.</p>

<p>It was one of Belle's greatest pleasures to
sit upon her papa's knee and turn over with
loving, reverent fingers the various articles of
jewelry which had once been her mother's,
and which were to be hers when she should
be of a proper age to have them and take
care of them. "Mamma's pretty things"
were a source of great enjoyment to her; and
although Belle loved dress as much as any
little girl of her age, it was with no thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of decking herself in them, but simply for
their own beauty and the sake of the dear
one who had once worn them, that they
were so prized. And now and then when
her papa gave her some trifle suitable for her,
she seldom wore it, so fearful would she be of
losing it, or lest other harm should come to it.
So now, as things were apt to come to harm
in Mabel's destructive fingers, she was very
much afraid of trusting the precious locket
within them; and stoutly, though not crossly,
refused to let her have it.</p>

<p>Mabel begged and promised, whined and
fretted; but the locket was still held beyond
her reach, till at last she made a dive and had
nearly snatched it from Belle's hold.</p>

<p>But Daphne's eye was upon her, and
Daphne's hand pulled her back as the old
woman <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Hi! dere! none ob dat, Miss Mabel. I
ain't goin fur see my ole missus' tings took
from my young missus, and me by to help it. I
ain't goin fur stan' dat, no way," and Daphne's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
grasp was rougher than it need to have been
as she held back the angry, struggling Mabel.</p>

<p>The child was in a great passion: she
struck wildly at the nurse, and screamed
aloud, so that her mother came running to
see what was the matter.</p>

<p>"There then, never mind," said Mrs. Walton,
as Mabel, released from Daphne's hold,
rushed to her and complained that Belle
would not let her touch her new locket,&mdash;"never
mind, I will give you something pretty
to look at."</p>

<p>"I want a locket like Belle's to keep for
my own," said Mabel; "and then I'll never
let her see it."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I wouldn't look at it," said Belle,
forgetting all her good resolves, "if you
showed it to me. I'd just squeeze my eyes
tight shut, and never open them till you took
it away. And I don't b'lieve the man in the
locket-store has any like this."</p>

<p>But Mabel had hardly left the room with
her mother before Belle was sorry, as usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
for the anger she had shown, and said remorsefully
to <span class="locked">Daphne,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"There now, I went and forgot the Bible
proverb papa gave me, and didn't give 'a
soft answer' to turn away Mabel's wrath,
but just spoke as cross as any thing, and was
real naughty. I'll just run after her, and let
her touch my locket very carefully with her
own hands."</p>

<p>And away she went, ready to make peace,
even by doing that which was not pleasant to
her; but the dear little thing was only partly
successful, for as Maggie afterwards said,
when Belle told her the story, "Mabel was of
that kind of nature that if you gave her an
inch she took an ell;" and no sooner did
Belle let her have the locket in her own hands
than she wanted to have it about her neck
and wear it. This was too much, even for
the little peace-maker: she could not make
up her mind to give way in this, nor, indeed,
could she have been expected to do so; and
quiet was not restored till Mabel's mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
was worried into taking her out at once in
search of such a locket as Belle's.</p>

<p>But the search proved quite fruitless, for
no locket exactly like Belle's could be found;
and Mabel would not be satisfied with one
that was different. In vain did she and her
mother go from jeweller's to jeweller's; in
vain did Mrs. Walton offer the spoiled child
lockets far more showy and costly than the
one on which she had set her heart; in vain
did the shopman assure her that such as she
desired were "quite out of the fashion," an
argument which generally went a good way
with Mabel: one just like Belle's she would
have.</p>

<p>"Then we will have one made," said Mrs.
Walton; and inquired when it could be finished.
But when the jeweller said it would
take a week or more, neither would this
satisfy the naughty child, who was in a mood
that was uncommonly perverse and obstinate
even for her.</p>

<p>"I shall have one to-day," she repeated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and was so very troublesome that even the
patience of her mistaken and spoiling mother
at last gave way, and the jeweller heartily
wished himself rid of such a noisy, ill-behaved
customer.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Walton gave the order, and
promised to bring Belle's locket for the jeweller
to see the pattern on Monday, this being
Saturday; and then returned home with her
naughty child.</p>

<p>Belle had gone out,&mdash;gone to Mrs. Bradford's
to spend the day with Maggie and
Bessie, as she always did on Saturday; and
Mabel was left to whine and fret by herself
till evening.</p>

<p>This gave her fresh cause of displeasure:
she was vexed at her cousin for leaving her
alone, and when Belle returned she was
greeted <span class="locked">with,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Mamma is going to take your locket
away from you on Monday, and take it to
the locket-man to make me one just like it."</p>

<p>"No," said Belle, backing from Mabel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
her father's knee, and holding fast with one
hand clasped over the other upon the beloved
locket, as if she feared it was to be snatched
from her at once.</p>

<p>"You'll let me take it to the jeweller for a
pattern, dear: won't you?" said her aunt.
"Mabel wants one just like it."</p>

<p>Belle shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt Fanny," she answered: "I
couldn't. It was my own mamma's, and I
couldn't let it go from me; and I don't want
anybody to have one just like it."</p>

<p>She did not speak unkindly or pettishly,
but with a quiet determination in her tone,
such as she sometimes showed, and which in
some cases might seem to be obstinacy. But
it was not so now; and it was evident that the
child had some deep and earnest reason for
her refusal,&mdash;a feeling that the little treasure
which had belonged to her mamma had something
so dear and sacred about it, that it could
not be suffered to pass into strange hands,
even for a time; nor could she bear to have
it copied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"The locket-man didn't know my own
mamma, Aunt Fanny," she answered again
to her aunt's persuasions: "maybe he
wouldn't be so very gently with it. I couldn't,&mdash;I
really couldn't."</p>

<p>Tears gathered in the eyes of the sensitive
little one as she spoke, and there was a piteous
tremble of her lip which forbade her aunt to
urge her farther; but Mabel was not to be so
put off.</p>

<p>"You cannot have it, Mabel," said Mr.
Powers. "I will not have Belle troubled in
this matter."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Mr. Walton, looking
up from his evening paper, to which he had
until now given all his attention, too much
accustomed to the fretful tones of his little
daughter's voice to pay heed to them when he
could avoid it.</p>

<p>The trouble was soon explained; and Mr.
Walton, who had lately awakened to the fact
that his Mabel had become a most troublesome
and disagreeable child, and that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
time for her to learn that she must sometimes
give up her own will and consider others, told
her that she must think no more of this new
whim; and that if she could not be contented
with such a locket as he might choose for her
on Monday, she should have none at all.</p>

<p>"Then I <em>won't</em> have any at all," said Mabel,
passionately. "And I won't eat any breakfast
or dinner or supper, not for any days."</p>

<p>"Just as you choose," said Mr. Walton,
coolly taking up his paper and beginning to
read again; while his wife looked pleadingly
at him, but to no purpose; and Belle sat gazing
in amazement at the child who dared to
speak in such a way to her father. Indulgent
as Mr. Powers always was to his motherless
little girl, she knew very well that he never
would have overlooked such disrespect as that,
nor could she have believed it possible that
she should ever be guilty of it.</p>

<p>Astonishment and indignation at this novel
mode of treatment held Mabel speechless
and quiet for a moment; then she set up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
roar which would have been surprising as
coming from so small a pair of lungs, to any
one who had not known her powers in that
particular.</p>

<p>But here again Mr. Walton, who, as Belle
afterwards told her papa, seemed to be disposed
to "turn over a new leaf about training
up Mabel in the way she should go," interfered,
and bade her go from the room, or be
quiet.</p>

<p>She chose neither; and the matter ended
by her father himself carrying her away, and
giving orders that she should be put to bed.</p>

<p>Belle was very sorry for all this, and could
not help feeling as if she somehow was to
blame, although the matter of the locket was
one too near her little heart to be given up.
But she went to her uncle when her own bed-time
came, and begged that she might go and
wish Mabel good-night, and be friends with
her once more.</p>

<p>But Mr. Walton thought it better, as did
Belle's own papa, that the wilful child should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be left to herself till the next day; and he
dismissed Belle with a kind kiss, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Mabel will feel better in the morning,
dear, and then she will be ready to make
friends with you; but just now I am afraid
she is still too naughty to meet you pleasantly."</p>

<i>BELLE'S MISFORTUNE.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-073.png" alt="M" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">Mr. Walton was sadly mistaken
when he thought that his little girl
would have forgotten her ill-temper
and be ready to be pleasant and good-humored
in the morning. Mabel awoke sulky and
pouting, quite determined to believe that Belle
had grievously injured her, and obstinately
refusing to be reconciled unless she would
consent to give up the locket.</p>

<p>Had Belle been willing to do this, her papa
and uncle would not have permitted it; but,
though Mabel was in a state of displeasure
with the world in general that morning, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
chose to consider Belle as chief offender, and
treated her accordingly.</p>

<p>"But it's Sunday," said Belle, when she
refused to kiss her for good-morning.</p>

<p>"Don't I know that?" snapped Mabel.</p>

<p>"But I don't like to be cross with any one
on Sunday," pleaded Belle.</p>

<p>"You're cross to me, and so I'll be cross
with you,&mdash;Sunday and Monday and every
day," said the disagreeable child. "Now
leave me be."</p>

<p>And Belle, seeing that Mabel was not to be
persuaded into a better temper, was forced to
do as she said, and let her alone.</p>

<p>And all day, Sunday though it was, Mabel
was even more peevish, exacting, and troublesome
than usual, till she was a burden and
torment to herself and every one about her.</p>

<p>When Monday morning came she was rather
more reasonable, but still persisted in being
"offended" with Belle, and even refused to
walk on the same side of the street with her
when they were going to school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you wear your new locket, Miss
Belle?" asked Daphne when she was making
her little mistress ready for school.</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," said Belle: "something
might happen to it, and maybe it's too nice."</p>

<p>"I reckon it's not too fancy," said Daphne,
holding up the locket and looking at it admiringly:
"you may wear it if you like, and
mebbe Miss Ashton would like to see it."</p>

<p>Now the locket was perhaps not quite a
proper thing for Belle to wear to school, and
had her father been there he might have
advised her to keep to her first decision; but
Daphne always liked to deck out her little
lady in all the finery she could lay her hands
on, and, had she not been held in check by
wiser heads, would often have sent her forth
to school in very improper guise. And as
Mabel was always very much dressed, it chafed
Daphne sorely to contrast the simple but more
suitable garments of her little Miss Belle
with the showy ones worn by her cousin.</p>

<p>So now she persuaded Belle to wear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
locket, saying, not to the child, but to herself,
that it "was time folks foun' out her folks was
wort somethin', an' had plenty of pretty things
if they on'y chose to show 'em;" and, rather
against the child's own better judgment, she
suffered the nurse to put the locket about her
neck.</p>

<p>It was well for Belle, and for those who had
the guiding of her, that she was such a docile
little girl, generally willing and anxious to do
that which she believed to be right, or she
might have been sadly injured by the spoiling
of her devoted but foolish old nurse. As it
was, it did not do her much harm; and
Daphne often felt herself put to shame by the
little one's uprightness and good sense.</p>

<p>However, on this morning Daphne had her
way; and, as I have said, the locket was put
on.</p>

<p>As might have been supposed, the new ornament
immediately attracted the attention of
all Belle's class-mates; and they crowded
about her before school opened, to examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and admire, with many an "oh!" and "ah!"
"how lovely!" and "how sweet!"</p>

<p>"Mabel, have you one too?" asked Dora
Johnson; for the children had found out by
this time that if Belle had a pretty thing,
Mabel was sure to have one also.</p>

<p>"I'm going to," said Mabel, "one just like
it: you see if I don't; even if that cross-patch
won't let the man have it to pattern off of.
She thinks herself so great nobody can have
a locket like hers."</p>

<p>"Belle's not a cross-patch," said Lily Norris;
"and, Mabel, if you talk that way about
her, we won't be friends with you, not any of
the class. Belle's old in the class, and you're
new; and we don't think so very much of
you. So you'd better look out."</p>

<p>Mabel and Lily were always at swords'
points; for Lily was saucy and outspoken,
very fond of Belle, and always upholding her
rights, or what she considered such.</p>

<p>"Belle's real selfish," muttered Mabel;
"and you shan't talk to me that way, Lily."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"God gave me my tongue for my own, and
I keep it for just what words I choose to say,"
said Lily, losing both temper and grammar in
her indignation; "and Belle's not selfish, but
you; and most always when peoples is selfish
themselves, they think other ones are that
ain't. That's the kind that you're of, Mabel."</p>

<p>"Now don't let's quarrel," said Nellie Ransom,
the prudent; "else Miss Ashton will
come, and send us to our seats."</p>

<p>"But, Belle, dear," said Dora, "what's the
reason you don't want Mabel to have a locket
like yours?"</p>

<p>Belle told her story; and very naturally
the sympathies of all her class-mates went
with her, and Mabel was speedily made to see
that she was thought to be altogether in the
wrong, which did not tend to restore her to
good humor.</p>

<p>"I <em>shall</em> take it to the locket-man for a
pattern," she said angrily: "you see if I
don't. I'll get it, ah-ha."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said Lily. "Belle knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
you. She'll take good enough care of it; and
just you <em>try</em> to snatch it now."</p>

<p>What would follow if she did, Lily plainly
expressed in the threatening shake of the
head with which she accompanied her words.</p>

<p>Farther quarrelling or unkind threats were
prevented by the entrance of Miss Ashton,
who called her little class to order, and school
was opened.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton had more trouble with Mabel
that morning than she had had any day since
she first came to school. She was pettish
and fretful beyond all reason; elbowed and
crowded the other children, pouted over her
lessons, and was disrespectful to her teacher,
and once broke into such a roar that Mrs.
Ashton hastily opened the doors between the
two rooms and inquired into the cause of the
trouble. This soon hushed Mabel's screams;
for the elder lady's looks were rather stern
and severe, and she at least was one person
of whom the wilful child stood in wholesome
dread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>But though quiet was restored for a time,
it was not to last long; and this seemed destined
to be a day of trouble, all through
Mabel's naughtiness. Miss Ashton called up
the arithmetic class; and as they stood about
her desk, she saw Mabel and Lily elbowing
one another with all their might,&mdash;the former
cross and scowling, the latter looking defiant
and provoking, and still half good-humored
too.</p>

<p>"Children! Lily and Mabel! What are
you doing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Can't Mabel keep her elbow out of my
part of the air, Miss Ashton?" said Lily.</p>

<p>"For shame!" said the lady: "two little
girls quarrelling about such a trifle as
that."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Ashton," pleaded Lily, "she
sticks me so! She oughtn't to take up any
more room than that;" and she measured
with her hand the portion of empty space
which according to her ideas rightfully belonged
to Mabel; while the latter, conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that she had been wilfully trespassing, had
nothing to say.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that my little scholars cannot
agree," said Miss Ashton. "Mabel, stand
back a little, and keep your elbows down, my
dear. If you cannot behave better, I shall be
forced to send you into the other room to my
mother; and all the young ladies there will
know you have been naughty."</p>

<p>To be sent into Mrs. Ashton in disgrace
was thought a terrible punishment; and Miss
Ashton had never yet had to put it in practice:
the mere mention of it was generally
enough to bring the naughtiest child to good
behavior, and it was a threat she seldom used.
But she knew that the solitude of the cloak-room
had quite lost its effect on Mabel, and
felt that some stronger measures must be
taken if there was to be any peace that
day.</p>

<p>Mabel obeyed; but in spite of the threatened
punishment, her temper so far got the
better of her that she could not resist giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Lily a parting thrust with her elbow,&mdash;a
thrust so hard that Lily's slate was knocked
from her hand and fell upon the floor, where
it broke into three or four pieces.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, Mabel was frightened; and
the other children stood almost breathless,
waiting for what Miss Ashton would say and
do.</p>

<p>She said nothing; what she did was to
rise quickly, take Mabel by the hand and turn
to lead her to the other room.</p>

<p>Dreading she hardly knew what, Mabel was
still too thoroughly terrified at the prospect
before her to rebel any farther, or to do more
than gasp <span class="locked">out,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Ashton! I won't do so any
more! I didn't mean to! I will be good!"</p>

<p>Miss Ashton did not answer, but drew her
on; when Belle, dropping her own slate beside
Lily's, sprang forward and laid her hand on
her teacher, looking up with eyes as appealing
as Mabel's.</p>

<p>"Please excuse her this time, Miss Ashton,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
she exclaimed. "I don't think she did
mean to break Lily's slate. She only meant
to joggle her, and the slate fell out of her
hand; but I don't believe she meant to do it.
Try her just this once, dear Miss Ashton:
maybe she will be good."</p>

<p>Miss Ashton looked down at the little
pleader and hesitated. Truth to tell, she had
not known how terrible a bugbear her mother
was to her young flock: she was sorry now
that she saw they had such a dread of her,
and perhaps was ready to seize upon an excuse
to relent and withdraw her threat.</p>

<p>"Oh! I will, I will be good! I'll never do
so any more!" sobbed Mabel.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton turned about, and taking her
seat placed Mabel in front of her.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "I will excuse
you this once; not because you do not deserve
punishment, Mabel, but because Belle begs
for you. But remember it is for this one
time. If you behave again as you have
done this morning, I shall certainly punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
you. And you must stand there now and
say your lesson apart from the other children."</p>

<p>Relieved from the dread of going to Mrs.
Ashton, Mabel did not so very much mind
that, or the cold, displeased glances of the
rest of the class; but as she took her place,
she cast a grateful look over at Belle, to
whom she truly felt she owed her escape; and
Belle felt quite repaid for the "love-charity"
which had helped her to forget and forgive
Mabel's unkind behavior to herself, and to
plead for her.</p>

<p>But the troubles which arose from Mabel's
misconduct had by no means come to an end.
Belle's place in the class was just at Miss
Ashton's left hand, and when she dropped her
slate it fell at the foot of the lady's chair. It
had escaped the fate of Lily's, not being even
cracked by the fall; but as poor little Belle
stooped to pick it up, a far worse misfortune
than the loss of her slate befell her. As she
raised her head, the slight chain about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
neck caught on the arm of the chair, and the
strain snapped it in two.</p>

<p>The sudden check and drag hurt Belle and
left an angry red mark about her neck, but
she did not heed the sting as she saw chain
and locket fall at her feet.</p>

<p>She did not say a word, only snatched it up
with a quick, long-drawn breath, and stood
for a moment looking at it with the utmost
dismay and grief in her countenance; while a
chorus of sympathizing exclamations arose
from the other children. The mischief done
was not so very great, and could easily be
repaired; but in Belle's eyes it seemed very
dreadful, and as though her treasure was very
nearly, if not quite, destroyed. Great tears
rose to her eyes and rolled slowly down her
cheeks; and she turned to Miss Ashton,
piteously holding out the locket in her
hand.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton hastened to bring comfort.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," she said cheerfully:
"it can easily be mended. Tell papa it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
an accident, and he will have it done for you,
I am sure."</p>

<p>"But now the jeweller man will <em>have</em> to
take it," said Lily, indignantly; "and Belle
didn't want to have it go 'way from her, and
it's all just for the way Mabel behaved. I
should think a broken locket and a broken
slate were just about too much consequences
of any one's naughtiness and hatefulness for
one day."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Lily," said Miss Ashton.</p>

<p>"But it's true, Miss Ashton: it all came of
that old Mabel's badness," persisted Lily.</p>

<p>"Lily, will you be quiet?" repeated her
teacher.</p>

<p>Lily dared say no more; but borrowing a
slate for the purpose from the child who stood
next her, she held it closely before her face,
and from behind that shelter made two or
three grimaces at Mabel, which, whatever
relief they might afford her own feelings, did
neither harm nor good to any one else, as they
were not seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Still Lily's words were felt by Belle and all
the rest of the class to be true. Belle's misfortune
was certainly the result of Mabel's
ill-behavior; and it was very hard for the
poor little girl to keep down the angry feelings
which seemed as if they would rise up to
accuse her cousin.</p>

<p>And Lily's speech or speeches, and the
knowledge that she was blamed by all her
class-mates, vexed Mabel again, and crushed
down the better feelings which had arisen
towards Belle, so that she put on an appearance
of complete indifference to her distress;
and muttered <span class="locked">sulkily,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I don't care."</p>

<p>"Put the locket carefully away in your
desk, dear," said Miss Ashton to Belle, "and
do not fret about it. Your papa will have
it fixed for you, and it will be as good as
ever."</p>

<p>Belle obeyed, putting the locket carefully in
one corner of her desk, with a rampart of
books raised about it; and then returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
her place, still rather disconsolate, and feeling
that she was fully entitled to all the pitying
and sympathizing looks bestowed upon
her.</p>

<p>After this the business of the class went on
without farther interruption, and the arithmetic
lesson came to an end.</p>

<i>A TERRIBLE LOSS.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-151.png" alt="W" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">When Miss Ashton dismissed the rest
of her little class for the recess which
they took in the course of the morning,
she told Mabel to come with her; and
taking her apart into a room by herself, she
talked gravely but kindly to her.</p>

<p>"Would you like it, my dear?" she said,
"if I sent you home with a note to your
mamma, saying I could no longer have you
in the school?"</p>

<p>Mabel hesitated a moment, half-inclined to
say that it was just what she would like; but
calling to mind the nice plays she often had
with her young school-mates, the pretty picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
cards she sometimes received from Miss
Ashton when she had been particularly good
or recited her lessons well, and several other
pleasures which school afforded, she thought
better of it, and said she would not like it at
all; adding to herself what she dared not say
aloud to Miss Ashton, that she would carry
no such note home, but throw it away in the
street if it was given to her.</p>

<p>"And I should be very sorry to do it," said
the young lady; "but, Mabel, unless you do
better, I cannot have you in my school. Why,
my dear, since you have been here there has
been more quarrelling and disturbance than
during all the rest of the time I have had the
class. This must not go on; for you cannot
stay with us if you will behave so as to destroy
all our peace and comfort."</p>

<p>Mabel hung her head; but she took the
reproof better than she generally received
any fault-finding; and after Miss Ashton had
talked a little more, setting her naughtiness
and its sad consequences plainly before her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and urging her to be good and amiable for
her own sake as well as because it was right,
she had permission to go, and left her teacher,
half-repentant, but still not quite determined
to take her advice and warnings and make up
her mind to be a better child.</p>

<p>In this perverse mood, she did not feel
like joining the other children, who were playing
on the piazza and out in the garden, but
wandered back to the school-room by herself.
She sat here a moment or two in her own
seat, which was next to Belle's, knocking her
feet idly against the floor, and wishing for
something to amuse herself with; but still
too proud or too sulky to go and play with the
others. But presently she bethought herself
once more of the locket, and the temptation
came to her to open Belle's desk and look at
it. Then Conscience whispered, "Shame!
shame! Belle was so kind to you, and begged
you off when Miss Ashton would have punished
you."</p>

<p>The still, small voice made itself heard so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
plainly that she could not refuse to listen at
first, but she tried to hush it, and at last
succeeded.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to do any harm," she said;
"only just to look at the locket, and that
can't hurt it. Belle won't know it, and she
won't be mad."</p>

<p>She opened Belle's desk and peeped in.</p>

<p>There lay the pretty trifle she coveted in
the snug corner where the little owner's hands
had so carefully placed it. Mabel looked and
looked, and from looking she went to touching
it. First with only one finger, feeling guilty
and ashamed all the time; for with all her
faults Mabel was not generally deceitful or
meddling. Presently growing bolder, she
took it up, shut down the lid of the desk, and
sat turning the locket over and over, wishing
that the jeweller were there, so that she might
show it to him while Belle knew nothing
about it.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a quick, running step
in the hall without; and before she had time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to open Belle's desk and put the locket in its
place, Dora Johnson came in. Mabel dropped
the locket in her lap, and threw her pocket-handkerchief
over it. Dora saw nothing
wrong, only Mabel sitting there with a very
red face, which she supposed to arise from
shame, as indeed it partly did, though it came
from a cause which Dora never suspected.</p>

<p>"It's beginning to rain, and we all have to
come in," said Dora; and the next moment
the whole troop of children running in proved
the truth of her words. They did not all
come into the school-room; but Dora and one
or two more were there, so that Mabel did not
dare to lift the lid of Belle's desk again and
put back the locket.</p>

<p>She was very much frightened, and would
have been content, glad indeed, to give up the
hope of any locket at all, to have had Belle's
safely back where she had left it. She knew
that her school-mates would all cry out shame
upon her if they saw that she had meddled
with the locket, and she knew that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
deserved this; but she shrank from the looks
and words of scorn and displeasure which she
knew would fall upon her when they discovered
the treachery she had been guilty of
towards her dear little cousin.</p>

<p>So she felt and thought as she sat there
with the locket hidden on her lap, and at last
feeling that she must rid herself of it by some
means, and fearing that Miss Ashton would
return to call them to order before she did so,
she rose and wandered out of the room, holding
the locket fast within her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Most of the children were in the hall, and
she went on into the cloak-room. There was
no one there; and as she looked about her,
wondering what she should do with the locket,
the bell rang to call the class back to their
places.</p>

<p>With no time to think, with no plan in her
head, not meaning to keep the locket from
Belle, nor yet seeing her way clearly to the
means of getting it back, Mabel hastily
dropped it in a corner upon the floor, snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
down her own hat and sacque and threw them
over it; then ran back to the school-room with
beating heart and crimson cheeks. No one
noticed her guilty looks; or, if they did, laid
them to the same cause that Dora Johnson
had done, and did not speak of them.</p>

<p>The class in reading was now called up;
and as Mabel took her stand about the middle
of the row, she gave her attention, not to the
task before her, but to the locket lying hidden
in the cloak-room, and tried to contrive a way
out of her difficulty.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck her, and she
gave a great sigh of relief. This was the day
on which Belle took her music-lesson after
school was dismissed: it might be that she
would not discover that the locket had been
taken out of her desk till she came to go
home; and she, Mabel, would have time to
put it back after the other children had left.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton's voice roused her, calling
back her thoughts to her lesson and reminding
her that it was her turn to read; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
did not know where the place was, and when
it was pointed out to her by Belle, she stumbled
and blundered over words that she knew
quite well, and read most disgracefully, finishing
her performance with a new burst of
crying.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton did not find fault with her,
believing perhaps that she really could not
help it, but passed on to the next. Would
she have taken it so quietly if she had known
the true cause of Mabel's excitement? The
child could not help asking herself this question,
or wondering what punishment she would
be called on to bear if her teacher knew all.
Not for twenty lockets such as Belle's would
she have borne the miserable feelings from
which she was suffering now.</p>

<p>So the time dragged on, heavily, heavily,
till it was the hour for dismissal; and the
little ones prepared to go home.</p>

<p>Mabel watched Belle's every motion, scarcely
daring to hope that she would not discover
her loss before she went downstairs to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
music-lesson; but Belle, never dreaming but
that her treasure lay safely hidden in the
far corner where she had left it, put books
and slate back into her desk in haste, and
at last followed Miss Ashton from the
room.</p>

<p>Then Mabel hurried into the cloak-room, a
new fear taking hold of her, as fears without
number or reason ever will of the guilty.
Suppose any of the other children had lifted
her sacque and found the locket beneath it!
No: it lay upon the floor still,&mdash;not just as
she had left it, it seemed to her fearful,
suspicious eyes. But no one turned upon
her with accusing words or looks; and she
believed herself safe, if she could but manage
to be the last child to go.</p>

<p>Nanette, her nurse, who was waiting for
her, was too well used to her freaks to be
much surprised when she declared she was
not going home just yet; and stood by, with
what patience she might, to await the pleasure
of her hard young task-mistress, who plumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
herself down on the floor upon her sacque
with a look of dogged determination, which
Nanette knew well would change to one of
furious passion if she were crossed.</p>

<p>As Lily Norris left the room, she could not
refrain from a parting shot at Mabel.</p>

<p>"Mabel," she said, "in the 'Nonsense
Book' there is a picture of a sulky girl sitting
on a carpet, and the reading about her begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There was a young lady of Turkey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose temper was exceedingly murky;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and I just b'lieve the man what took her portrait,
and made the poetry about her, meant
you;" with which, mindful of the fact that
Mabel's hand was swift and heavy when she
was provoked, she flew from the room, chuckling
over her own joke, and joined in her
laughter by those who followed her, Lily being
considered a great wit.</p>

<p>So had Mabel set all her young school-mates
against her that there was scarcely one who
did not enjoy a laugh at her expense. But
just now Mabel was too much troubled about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
another matter to vex herself concerning
Lily's tantalizing words; and she was only
too thankful to see all the children leave the
cloak-room one after another.</p>

<p>The moment the last one had disappeared,
she ordered her nurse to go out and stand in
the entry; sprang to her feet and snatched
up the sacque, intending to run with the locket
and pop it into Belle's desk without loss of
time.</p>

<p>But&mdash;there was no locket there!</p>

<p>She shook out her sacque and turned it
over and over, looked in her hat, searched all
about the corner, and then threw her eyes
hastily around the room; all in vain. The
locket was certainly gone; and the next
moment a cry, half of rage, half of alarm
and despair, brought Nanette back to the
room.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, seeing by the
child's face that it was no ordinary fit of temper
that ailed Mabel.</p>

<p>"It's gone! Oh, it's gone!" sobbed Mabel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
wringing her hands and looking the very picture
of distress.</p>

<p>"But what is gone? What have you lost?"
asked the maid.</p>

<p>Then Mabel recollected herself, and cried
less loudly: she would not have even Nanette
know how naughty she had been, how meanly
she had acted towards the dear little cousin
who had been so kind to her; for, mingled
with her own fears for herself, there was a
feeling of deep remorse for the trouble she
had brought upon Belle.</p>

<p>What would the latter say when she should
discover her loss?</p>

<p>And, oh dear! oh dear! what was she to
do herself?</p>

<p>Even her own indulgent and all-excusing
mother could hardly overlook such a thing as
this.</p>

<p>She ceased her loud cries and tried to choke
back the sobs, but in vain did she wipe her
eyes again and again: the tears gathered and
rolled down her cheeks as fast as she dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
them away; and presently Miss Ashton, who
had heard her cries, came running upstairs,
followed by Belle, to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>But the moment she saw them, Mabel turned
sullen, pouted out her lips, and would not
speak; nor could Nanette give any explanation
of the cause of the commotion she had
made. And Miss Ashton, much displeased at
this new disturbance, bade the nurse put on
Mabel's things and take her home at
once.</p>

<p>Mabel was glad enough to obey, and she
suffered Nanette to lead her home as quietly
as a lamb, though she could not help a tear
and a sigh now and then; and Nanette wondered
much what secret trouble should have
brought about this distress.</p>

<p>Nor was Mabel's mamma more successful
in discovering the cause, when she noticed the
traces of tears and observed the child's evident
unhappiness. Mabel would not speak, or confess
what she had done; and she shrank from
her mother's caresses and coaxings, and hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
around in sullen, miserable silence, waiting
till Belle should come home grieved to the
heart, as she knew she would be, by the loss of
her much-prized locket.</p>

<p class="dropcap">And meanwhile how was it with little
Belle?</p>

<p>Daphne went for her young mistress
at the appointed hour, and as soon as
the music-lesson was finished took her upstairs
to make her ready.</p>

<p>"An' whar's yer locket, honey?" she
asked, immediately missing the ornament
from about the child's neck.</p>

<p>"In my desk: it did come to a danger,
Daphne. I broke the chain and had to put it
away. I'm going to bring it, and give it to
you to carry home very carefully, so it won't
be lost."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how did it come broke, dear?"
questioned the old woman.</p>

<p>"The chain caught on Miss Ashton's chair
and just came right in two," said Belle,
refraining from blaming her cousin, upon
whom she knew Daphne looked with such an
unfavorable eye.</p>

<p>And away she ran into the school-room,
Daphne following, and opened her desk.</p>

<p>"Why!" she exclaimed, seeing the locket
was not where she had left it; and then hastily
fell to turning her books about and
looking beneath them.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear heart? Whar am it
gone?" said Daphne, seeing no locket, and
observing the disturbance of her little charge.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I left it here,&mdash;right here
in this corner. Oh! Daffy, I know I did; and
I never touched it again. Miss Ashton told me
not, not till I went home; and I did mind her,
oh! I did; but it isn't there. Oh! Daffy,
you look, quick. Oh! my locket, mamma's
own locket!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Daphne turned over each book as hurriedly
as Belle had done; then took them all out and
shook them, peered within the empty desk,
and swept her hand around it again and again;
looked on the floor beneath: but all in vain.
The locket was certainly not there, and Belle's
face grew each moment more and more
troubled.</p>

<p>"You's forgot, and took it out again,
honey," said the old woman at last.</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't: how could I forget? And I
don't dis'bey Miss Ashton when she tells me
don't do a thing. I don't, Daphne; and I
couldn't forget about my mamma's locket;"
and the poor little thing burst into tears.
Such tears!</p>

<p>If any of you have ever lost something
which to you was very dear and sacred, which
you looked upon as a treasure past all price,
and which you would not have exchanged for
a hundred pretty things, each one of far more
value, you may know how Belle felt at this
unlooked-for and, to her, mysterious disappearance
of her locket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, don't yer, honey-pot,&mdash;don't yer,"
said Daphne, vainly trying to soothe her:
"'twill be foun', I reckon; but if you ain't
took it out, some one else has, for sartain. It
ain't walked out ob yer desk widout han's, for
sartain sure."</p>

<p>"Oh! but, Daffy, who would take it? who
would be so bad to me? They knew I loved
it so. I don't b'lieve anybody could tease me
so, when they knew it was my own dead
mamma's locket," sobbed the little one.</p>

<p>"Um! I spec' it warn't for no teasin' it
war done," said Daphne, half hesitating; then
her resentment and anger at the supposed
thief getting the better of her prudence, she
added, "I did allus know Miss Mabel wor a
bad one; but I <em>didn't</em> tink she so fur trabelled
on de broad road as to take to stealin',&mdash;and
de property ob her own kin too."</p>

<p>The word "stealing" silenced Belle, and
checked her tears and cries for a moment or
two.</p>

<p>"Stealing!" she repeated; "Mabel wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
steal, Daffy. Oh, that would be too dreadful!
She must know better than that. She couldn't
<em>steal</em> my locket."</p>

<p>"Dunno," said Daphne, dryly: "'pears uncommon
like it. Who you s'pose is de tief
den, Miss Belle?"</p>

<p>"But we don't have thiefs in our school,
Daphne," said the little girl: "we wouldn't do
such a thing, and Miss Ashton would never
'low it."</p>

<p>"Dey don't ginerally ask no leave 'bout
dere comin's an' goin's," said Daphne: "if
dey did, I specs der'd be less of 'em. You
'pend upon it, Miss Belle, dat ar locket's been
stealed; an' I can put my finger on who took
it right straight off."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Belle, whose distress was
still for the time overcome by her horror at
Daphne's suggestion, "I don't b'lieve any one
would do such a thing; and, Daphne," raising
her small head with a little dignified air, and
looking reprovingly at the old woman, "I
don't b'lieve, either, that it is very proper for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
you to call Mabel a thief. Maybe she took it
to show to the jeweller man, but I know she
couldn't steal it. But, oh dear! oh dear! I
wonder if I will ever have it back again, my
own, own mamma's locket;" and the sense of
her loss coming over her with new force, she
laid her head down upon her desk and cried
aloud.</p>

<p>For the second time the sounds of distress
called Miss Ashton to see what the trouble
was; and they brought also the older girls
from Mrs. Ashton's room, for their recess
was not yet quite over. They all crowded
about Belle, asking what was the matter, and
trying to soothe her; for Belle was a great
favorite and pet in the school, partly because
she was motherless,&mdash;poor little one!&mdash;which
gave teachers and scholars all a tender feeling
toward her, partly because she had many
taking and pretty ways of her own, which
made her very attractive to every one who
knew her.</p>

<p>In her uncertainty and distress the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
could not make plain the cause of her trouble;
and Daphne took upon herself the task of
explanation, glad, if the truth were known, of
the chance. Nor was she backward in expressing
her own views of the matter, and in
boldly asserting that the locket had been
stolen, and she knew by whom.</p>

<p>But at this, Belle roused herself and interrupted
her nurse.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, shaking her head as
she looked up with face all drowned in tears,
and hardly able to speak for sobbing,&mdash;"no,
no, Miss Ashton, Daphne <em>must</em> be mistaken.
Mabel never would do it,&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>Now in spite of all her own declarations to
the contrary, the fact was that Daphne's repeated
accusations, and the recollection of Mabel's
threats that she would "have the locket
<em>somehow</em>," had caused a doubt to enter little
Belle's mind as to the possibility and probability
of Mabel being the "thief" Daphne
called her; but mindful of the "love-charity"
she was determined to feel for her cousin,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
charity which "believeth all things, hopeth
all things,"&mdash;she tried to put this doubt from
her, and to think that some one else was the
guilty person, or that the locket had only been
taken to tease her. And she was not willing
that others should join in Daphne's
suspicions and believe that Mabel could do
such a thing.</p>

<p>But Miss Ashton herself had too much reason
to fear that Daphne's idea was, in part at
least, correct. Enough had come to her ears
and passed before her eyes, to make her
believe that Mabel, in her extreme wilfulness,
would not hesitate at any means of gaining
her point, especially in the matter of the
locket. She did not, it is true, feel sure that
Mabel intended to keep the locket; but she
thought she had probably taken it against her
cousin's will, for purposes of her own; and
this was hardly less dishonest than if she had,
according to Daphne, <em>stolen</em> it outright.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton was very much disturbed.
Mabel was proving such a source of trouble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
such a firebrand in her little school, which
had until now gone on in so much peace and
harmony, that she had felt for some days as
if it were scarcely best to keep her; still for
many reasons she did not wish to ask her
mother to remove her.</p>

<p>She thought it better for Mabel to be thrown
more with other children than she had hitherto
been; and her hope of doing her some good
could not be put away readily; and also she
shrank from offending and grieving the child's
relatives, especially Mr. Powers, who had
been a good friend to her mother and herself.</p>

<p>But if Mabel was a child of so little principle
as to do a thing like this, it was best to
send her away at once, she thought; and
there seemed too much reason to fear that it
was so.</p>

<p>However, she said nothing of all this to
Belle, and when the old colored woman began
again, gently stopped her, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"That will do, Daphne: we will not say any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
more about this. Belle, my dear, open your
desk and let us search again."</p>

<p>Of course the desk was searched in vain,
and not only the desk, but the whole school-room;
Miss Ashton faintly hoping that Belle
might accidentally have pulled the locket out
and dropped it on the floor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bell had rung to call the
older girls back to their class; and Mrs. Ashton,
hearing the story from them, came also to
Belle to make some inquiries. This was a
serious matter, the disappearance of a valuable
thing from the desk of one of her little
scholars, and needed to be thoroughly sifted.
But as soon as she appeared, Belle was seized
with that unfortunate dread of the elder lady
which possessed all the little girls; and she
thought what would become of Mabel if Mrs.
Ashton, too, believed her to be a "thief."
Visions of squads of policemen, prisons and
chains, danced before her mind's eye; and
her imagination, almost as quick and fertile
as Maggie Bradford's, pictured her cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
dragged away by Mrs. Ashton's orders, while
the rest of the family were plunged in the
deepest grief and disgrace.</p>

<p>So it was but little satisfaction that Mrs.
Ashton gained from her, in reply to her questions.
Not so Daphne, however; finding that
her young lady gave such short and low
answers as could scarcely be understood, she
once more poured forth her opinions till again
ordered to stop.</p>

<p>However, there was one opinion in which
all were forced to agree; namely, that the
locket was certainly gone. Belle's sobs were
quieted at last, save when a long, heavy sigh
struggled up now and then; but her face wore
a piteous, grieved look which it went to Miss
Ashton's heart to see. With her own hands,
she put on the child's hat and sacque, petting
her tenderly and assuring her that she would
leave no means untried to discover her lost
treasure; and then Belle went home with her
nurse.</p>

<p>Daphne stalked with her charge at once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Mrs. Walton's room; and, forgetting her
usual good manners, threw open the door
without knocking, and standing upon the
threshold <span class="locked">proclaimed,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Miss Walton, Miss Belle's locket am clean
gone, chain an' all; an' de Lord will sure
foller wid His judgment on dem what's robbed
a moderless chile."</p>

<p>Her words were addressed to Mrs. Walton;
but her eyes were fastened on Mabel, who
shrank from both look and words, knowing
full well that Daphne suspected her of being
the guilty one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton held out her hand kindly to
Belle.</p>

<p>"Come here, darling," she said, "and tell
me all about it. Your locket gone? How is
that?"</p>

<p>Belle told her story in as few words as
possible, avoiding any mention of Mabel's
naughtiness in school that morning, or of the
threats she had used about the locket. She
did not even look at Mabel as she spoke, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
all the way home the dear little soul had been
contriving how she might act and speak so as
not to let Mabel see that she had any doubt of
her.</p>

<p>"'Cause maybe she didn't take it," she said
to herself: "it isn't a <em>very</em> maybe, but it's a
little maybe; and I would be sorry if I b'lieved
she took it and then knew she didn't; and
she might be offended with me for ever and
ever if I thought she was a thief."</p>

<p>But the puzzle had been great in Belle's
mind; for she thought, "If she took it for a
pattern for the locket-man and not to keep it,
I wonder if it wasn't somehow a little bit like
stealing;" and she could not help the suspicion
that Mabel had really done this.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton was full of sympathy and pity,
and asked more questions than Belle felt able
or willing to answer; but it never entered her
mind to suspect her own child.</p>

<p>And, indeed, with all her sad, naughty ways,
she had never known Mabel to tell a wilful
falsehood, or to take that which did not belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to her in a deceitful, thievish manner. She
would, it is true, insist that the thing she
desired should be given to her, and often
snatch and pull at that which was another's,
or boldly help herself in defiance of orders to
the contrary; but to do this in a secret way,
to be in the least degree dishonest or false,
such a thing would have seemed quite impossible
to Mrs. Walton.</p>

<p>"Can it be that one of your little class-mates
is so very wicked?" she said. "Miss
Ashton should see to this at once: it is almost
impossible that she should not discover the
thief if she makes proper efforts."</p>

<p>How did the words of her unsuspecting
mother sound to the ears of the guilty little
daughter who stood in the recess of the window,
half hidden by the curtains, but plainly
hearing all that passed as she pretended to be
playing with her dolls?</p>

<p>Would Miss Ashton find her out? Would
it not be better to go at once and confess?</p>

<p>And it was not only fear for herself which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
led Mabel to hesitate thus: she was really
full of remorse and sorrow for the trouble
which her wicked, selfish conduct had brought
upon Belle; and as she saw how her forgiving
little cousin avoided blaming her, these feelings
grew stronger and stronger, till they
almost overcame the selfishness which ruled
her. But not quite; and she resolved to
make amends to Belle in some other way.</p>

<p>She thought she was doing this, and showing
great generosity, when she came out of
her corner, and said to her <span class="locked">mother,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Mamma, please buy a very nice locket,
and let Belle have it 'stead of me. I'll give
it up to her, 'cause hers is gone."</p>

<p>Whatever suspicions Belle might have had
were at once put to flight by this; but the
offer had no charms for her. No other locket
could take the place of mamma's; and she
shook her head sadly, as she <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No, thank you, Mabel: I don't want any
other locket to make up that one. I couldn't
wear it, indeed I couldn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The melancholy tone of her voice brought
back all Mabel's self-reproach, and of the two
children she was perhaps really the most unhappy;
but still she could not resolve to confess,
though Conscience whispered that if she
told what she had done, there might be more
chance of finding the locket.</p>

<p>Had she not felt too much ashamed and
unworthy of praise, she might have been consoled
by all that her mother lavished upon
her for her offer to Belle. Such unheard-of
generosity on Mabel's part was something so
new and delightful that Mrs. Walton could not
say enough in its praise; and both she and
Mr. Walton began to hope that companionship
with other children, and Belle's good example,
were really doing her good. Little did they
think what was the true cause of the proposed
self-denial, or of Mabel's evident low spirits.</p>

<p>When Mr. Powers came home, he was
almost as much disturbed as Belle to hear of
the fate of her locket; and when she had gone
to rest that evening, he went to see Miss Ashton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to ask if she could take no steps for its
recovery.</p>

<p>He was very grave and silent when he came
back; and neither that evening nor the next
morning did he have much to say concerning
it, save that he comforted his little daughter
by telling her that he had good hope it would
be found.</p>

<i>CONFESSION AND REPENTANCE.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-073.png" alt="M" /></div>

<p class="dropcap">Mabel declared herself not well
enough to go to school the next
morning; and there seemed some
reason to believe it was really so, so dull and
spiritless and unlike herself she appeared;
and her mother allowed her to remain at
home. The true reason was, that she feared
to face Miss Ashton and her school-mates.</p>

<p>In vain did her mother try to find out the
cause of her trouble, for it was easy to be seen
that it was more than sickness.</p>

<p>But the day was not to pass over without
Mrs. Walton learning this. For that afternoon
Mabel was much startled, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
mother somewhat surprised, by a call from
Miss Ashton. Mabel shrank away from her
teacher, and said she had to go to her uncle's
rooms and play with Belle; and Miss Ashton
was not sorry to have her go, as she was
about to ask Mrs. Walton to see her alone.</p>

<p>She said this as soon as the child had left
the room, adding that she had come on what
might prove a painful business; and then told
Mrs. Walton all that had passed about the
locket on the day before, part of which she
had gathered from the other children, part she
had known herself. She had reason to fear,
she said, that Mabel had taken the locket, as
she had threatened to have it, in one way or
another; and had been the only one alone in
the room with opportunity to take it from
Belle's desk. She told, also, how strangely
Mabel had acted when she was leaving school
the day before; and said, although it might
not be so, she could not help thinking that
this might be connected with the disappearance
of the locket. When Mr. Powers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
called upon her the evening before, she told
him all she knew, but begged him to say nothing
to or about Mabel until she had questioned
the other children, and found out who had
been in the room beside herself. No one else,
so far as she could learn, had been there
alone; but the moment Dora Johnson heard
that Belle's locket was lost, she had cried out
that Mabel must have taken it during recess,
and that was the reason she had "acted so
queer and mysterious." This was the general
opinion among the class, and they were all
loud in their indignation against Mabel. She,
Miss Ashton, had told them they must not
judge too hastily; but she could not herself
deny that suspicion pointed very strongly
towards the child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton was much distressed, but also
much displeased, that Miss Ashton, or any one
else, should believe Mabel to be guilty. She
had never known her to practise deceit or
dishonesty of any kind, she said; and insisted
on sending at once for the child and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
questioning her. Miss Ashton did not object,
hoping to be able to judge from Mabel's manner
whether she were guilty or not; and Mrs.
Walton, saying she was determined to hear
all that the children had to say on the subject,
sent the nurse to bring both Belle and
Mabel.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Ashton gone?" asked the latter
when the messenger came.</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle," said Nanette.</p>

<p>"Then I shan't go. I don't want to see
her," said Mabel. "Belle, don't go. Stay
and play with me."</p>

<p>But Belle, who was very fond of her teacher
and always liked to see her, and who, moreover,
had a faint hope that she might have
brought some good news about the locket,
insisted on going to her aunt's room; and
Mabel, dreading the same thing and yet not
daring to stay behind, reluctantly followed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton and Miss Ashton looked from
one to the other of the children as they entered;
and as the former saw Mabel's downcast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
shamefaced look as she came forward,
her heart sank within her.</p>

<p>What if Mabel should be really guilty, after
all?</p>

<p>"Did you find any thing of my locket, Miss
Ashton?" asked little Belle, as soon as she
had welcomed the young lady.</p>

<p>"Not yet, dear; but I have some hope of
doing so," answered Miss Ashton, looking at
Mabel. "Now, I want you to tell your aunt
and myself all you can about it. You are
quite sure you did not touch it after I saw
you put it in your desk?"</p>

<p>"Quite, quite sure, ma'am; and I never
went to my desk after that, 'cept to put away
my slate; and there's nothing more to tell
about it, Miss Ashton, only how I went there
to give it to Daphne, and couldn't find it. It
was perferly gone," and Belle gave a long
sigh, which told how deep her loss lay.</p>

<p>"Mabel," said Mrs. Walton, suddenly, "did
you see Belle's locket after it was broken?"</p>

<p>Mabel hung her head more than ever, stammered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and stuttered, and finally burst into
tears.</p>

<p>Belle looked at her, colored, and hesitated;
then stepped up to her, and putting her arm
about her shoulder <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I don't b'lieve Mabel did take it, Aunt
Fanny: I don't think she could be so mean to
me. I <em>tried</em> not to b'lieve it, and now I don't
think I do. Please don't you and Miss Ashton
b'lieve so either, Aunt Fanny."</p>

<p>Belle's "love-charity" was too much for
Mabel. Taking her hands from before her
face, she clasped them about her cousin's neck,
and sobbed <span class="locked">out,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Oh! I did, Belle. I did take it out of
your desk; but I never, never meant to keep
it,&mdash;no, not even to show to the locket-man;
but I couldn't find it to put it back; and I'm
so sorry, I'll just give you any thing in the
world of mine, 'cept my papa and mamma."</p>

<p>Mabel's words were so incoherent that all
her hearers could understand was that she had
taken the locket; and though Belle had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
obliged to try hard to believe in her cousin's
honesty, the shock to the faith she had built
up was now so great that her arm dropped
from Mabel's shoulder, and she stood utterly
amazed and confounded. Mrs. Walton, too,
sat as if she were stricken dumb; and Miss
Ashton was the first to speak, which she did
in a tone more grieved and sorrowful than
stern.</p>

<p>"And where is the locket now, Mabel?
Did you say you cannot find it?"</p>

<p>Mabel shook her head in assent.</p>

<p>"What have you done with it?" asked
Mrs. Walton, in a tone that Mabel had never
known her mother use to her before.</p>

<p>The whole story was at last drawn from the
child, accompanied with many sobs and tears.
Belle put full faith in all she said, and almost
lost sight of her own trouble in sympathy for
Mabel's distress. Her arm went back about
her cousin's neck, and her own pocket-handkerchief
was taken out to wipe away Mabel's
tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>But Miss Ashton plainly did not believe her
story, and even her own mother was doubtful
of its truth; for it was told with so much
hesitation and stammering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton turned to Miss Ashton, with a
look which the young lady hardly knew how
to answer, except by one which asked that the
children should be sent away again; which
was done.</p>

<p>"You do not believe what Mabel says, Miss
Ashton?" said Mrs. Walton.</p>

<p>"I do not see how it can be so," replied
Miss Ashton: "I do not believe there is a child
in my class who is not honest; and they all
love Belle too much to think of teasing her
in any way. Moreover, I know that not one of
them was in the cloak-room from the time of
the short recess till they were dismissed; and
had any child had the will, I do not see that
she had the opportunity, to take the locket."</p>

<p>"But your servants?" questioned the anxious
mother.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton shook her head sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"My mother's two older servants have been
with us for years," she said, "and are quite
above suspicion. The younger one, the colored
girl, Marcia, who sometimes waits on
the children, and now and then goes into the
cloak-room, was not in the house. Her sister
was sick, and she had been allowed to go to
her for the day. She is not, I fear, strictly
honest, and has now and then been detected
in picking and stealing; and, although I have
never known her to take any thing of much
value, there is no saying how far temptation
might lead her; but, as I say, she was not at
home at the time. I grieve to distress you
farther, Mrs. Walton; but I do not see that
Mabel's story can be true."</p>

<p>"What do you think she has done with the
locket?" asked Mrs. Walton, in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>"How could I tell, my dear madam?" replied
Miss Ashton, looking with pity at the
other lady. "It may be that she has really
lost it, but in some other way than the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
she relates; or it may be&mdash;that she has it
still."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Mrs. Walton; but although
she said the word, the tone of her
voice told that she did not believe it impossible.
"Mabel is a troublesome, spoiled child,
I allow," continued the poor mother; "but I
have never known her to tell me a deliberate
falsehood, and to make up such a story as
this."</p>

<p>"I will have the school-room thoroughly
searched," said Miss Ashton; "and whether
the locket is found or no, we will at least give
Mabel the benefit of the doubt, and treat her
as if she were not more guilty than she
acknowledges herself to be, unless it is proved
that she knows more about it than she says;"
and then she rose, and, shaking hands with
Mrs. Walton, once more said how sorry she
was for the trouble she had been obliged to
bring her, and went away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two children had gone back
to Belle's nursery, where that dear little girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
set herself to the task of consoling Mabel as
well as she might.</p>

<p>But this was a difficult matter. So long as
she had her own way, Mabel generally cared
little whether or not people thought her a
naughty girl; but as she was really pretty
truthful and upright, she was now half-heartbroken
at the idea of being considered dishonest
and deceitful. She could not quite
acquit herself of the latter, since she had
taken advantage of Belle's absence to do that
which she would not have done in her presence,
and now she was very much ashamed of
it; but this seemed to her very different from
telling a falsehood, which she plainly saw Miss
Ashton, and her mother too, suspected her of
doing.</p>

<p>She threw herself down on the floor of the
nursery in a passion of tears and sobs; and
when Belle, sitting down by her, begged her
not to cry so, <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I will, I will: they think I told a story,
mamma and Miss Ashton do. I can't bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Miss Ashton,&mdash;horrid, old thing! She made
mamma think I did. She's awfully ugly: her
nose turns up, and I'm glad it does,&mdash;good
enough for her."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mabel," said Belle, "Miss Ashton's
nose don't turn up. It turns down about as
much as it turns up, I think. I b'lieve it's as
good as ours."</p>

<p>"I shan't think it is," said Mabel. "I'm
going to think it turns up about a million of
miles. And, Belle, 'cause everybody thinks
I took your locket to keep, and told a wicked
story about it, I shall never eat any more
breakfast or dinner or supper, but starve myself,
so they'll be sorry."</p>

<p>Belle was too well used to such threats from
Mabel to be very much alarmed at this.</p>

<p>Mabel went on, trying to make a deeper
impression.</p>

<p>"I shan't ever eat any more French sugar-plums,"
then as the recollection of a tempting
box of these delicacies came over her,&mdash;"'cept
only there are three candied apricots in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the box papa brought me last night. I'll eat
two of them, and give you the other; and then
never eat another thing, 'cause nobody believes
me; and it is true,&mdash;oh! it is."</p>

<p>"I b'lieve you, dear," said Belle. "I don't
think you would be so bad to me,&mdash;truly I
don't."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Mabel, turning around
her flushed, tear-stained face; "then I'll give
you two apricots, Belle, and only keep one
myself; and then starve myself. You're real
good to me, Belle, and nobody else is. You're
the only friend I have left in the world," she
concluded in a tragic whisper, as she sat up
and dried her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll try to coax them not to think you did
mean to keep it and tell a story about it," said
her little comforter.</p>

<p>"Belle, what makes you so good to me,
when I was so bad to you?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"'Cause I want you to love me, and be good
to me too," answered Belle. "And, besides,
Jesus don't want us to be good only to people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
who are good to us. He wants us to be good
to people who are bad to us too."</p>

<p>Mabel sat looking at her cousin in some
wonder.</p>

<p>"Do you care very much what Jesus
wants?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Belle: "don't you?"</p>

<p>"What does He think about me, I wonder?"
said Mabel, musingly, without answering
Belle's question, which indeed answered
itself, as the recollection of some of her
cousin's naughty freaks returned to her.
But she said nothing about these; for Mabel's
speech brought a thought which she hastened
to put into words, thinking that it might give
the latter some comfort.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mabel," she said eagerly, "He knows
all about the locket; and if you do tell the
truf, He b'lieves you, and I am sure He's
sorry for you too, even if you was a little
naughty about it."</p>

<p>It was a pity that the mother and the
governess were not there to see the way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
which Mabel's face lighted up. They must
have been convinced that, however much she
had been to blame, the story she now told was
true. Guilt could never have worn that look
at the thought that the all-seeing Eye read
her heart and believed in her innocence.</p>

<p>And if there was any lingering doubt in little
Belle's mind, it was cleared away by that look.</p>

<p>"Now I truly know she is not telling a
story," she said to herself, "'cause she looks
so glad that Jesus knows all about it; and if
she had, she would be frightened to think He
knew she was so wicked."</p>

<p>"It's nice to think Jesus knows about it and
b'lieves you, isn't it?" she said aloud.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mabel; "and I love Him for
it, and I do love you too; and I'll always love
you till I'm all starved and dead. Belle, I
know you do care what Jesus wants, 'cause
you try to be good and kind. I've just a good
mind to try too. Maybe if I do, He'll make
them find out where that locket went to."</p>

<p>Now perhaps Mabel's two resolutions did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
not agree very well the one with the other;
but there was no fear that the first would hold
good longer than till supper-time, nor was the
hope of reward for herself the best motive for
the second. But Belle, and perhaps a higher
ear than little Belle's, was glad to hear her
say this; and indeed it was a token for good.
For Mabel was beginning to see the beauty
and sweetness of Belle's conduct, and the
warmth and light of her example were taking
effect on that perverse and selfish little heart.
Belle was proving a "sunbeam" to Mabel,
though she did not know it herself.</p>

<i>MABEL'S GENEROSITY.</i></a></h2>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/d-200.png" alt="I" /></div>

<p class="dropcap-i">It would be impossible to tell how
troubled and disturbed poor Mrs.
Walton was by Miss Ashton's story.
So was Mr. Walton when he came home and
heard it. It was hard to think that their own
and only child could be guilty of such a thing;
and yet suspicion pointed so strongly towards
her that it was almost impossible to believe
otherwise. They talked it over between themselves,
and with Mr. Powers when he came;
and then the children were called, and told to
repeat all they knew once more.</p>

<p>Mabel's story was in no way different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that she had told before, save that it was
given with far less hesitation and difficulty,
but in no other respect did it vary from the
first; and here was ground for hope that it
was true.</p>

<p>Belle, too, told her tale with the same
straightforwardness and simplicity that she
had done before, but it threw no light on
what was so dark; and, as she had done from
the first, she carefully avoided throwing any
blame on her cousin, and concluded in these
words, uttered in a pleading <span class="locked">voice:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Please, papa, and uncle, and Aunt Fanny,
don't believe Mabel took my locket to keep: I
don't believe she did, not one bit; and I don't
want any one else to think she did."</p>

<p>"Why do you think she did not, dear?"
asked Mr. Walton.</p>

<p>"First I <em>tried</em> not to think she did," said
Belle; "and then when I told her Jesus knew
if she was telling the truf, she was glad, and
felt better about it, so that made me quite
sure. If she had hidden it on purpose to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it, she would be afraid if she thought Jesus
knew it."</p>

<p>Her words brought great comfort and new
hope to the father and mother.</p>

<p>"Let's all think she didn't do it, unless we
have to be very, very sure she did; and please
kiss her, and make up with her, Aunt Fanny,
'cause she feels so bad about it," persisted
Belle, drawing her cousin forward, as she
stood hanging her head, half-sullen, half-shamefaced,
and sorrowful at the suspicion
she felt cast upon her. "Aunt Fanny, if I
had my own mamma here with me, I would
feel very dreadful to know she thought I hid
something to steal it, and told ever so many
stories about it."</p>

<p>Who could resist her?</p>

<p>Not the mother certainly! who, only too
glad to believe her child innocent of more than
she had acknowledged, put her arms about her
and gave her a kiss of forgiveness; while
Mabel laid her head against her mamma's
shoulder, and cried there such gentle, penitent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
tears as she had seldom shed before. For the
sweeter and kinder Belle was to her, the more
deeply repentant she felt for the wrong she
had really done her. And not for the matter
of the locket alone did she sorrow: she
remembered and felt remorseful for many
another selfish, unkind act and speech, and
she could not but contrast with shame her
cousin's conduct with her own.</p>

<p>"Dear, little Belle!" said her uncle: "hers
is the charity that 'thinketh no evil.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Walton said this, knowing nothing of
the rules by which Belle had lately tried to
govern her behavior to Mabel as well as to
others.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Powers, drawing his little
daughter fondly towards him, and kissing her
forehead,&mdash;"yes, I believe Belle is really
trying for that charity which may keep us in
love and peace with God and man."</p>

<p>"Papa," whispered Belle, with her arms
about his neck, "it used to be real hard not
to think Mabel was the spoildest, worst child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that ever lived, and that would do all kinds
of bad things; and now I don't like to think
that about her, or to have other people think
so. Is that 'cause I tried to have love-charity
for her? Bessie said it was when I told
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, I think so."</p>

<p>"And, papa, Maggie said one of her nice,
pleasant-sounding things. She said when we
were like sunbeams ourselves it made things
look bright and good that would look ugly
and dark if we were not nice and bright ourselves.
Maggie makes sunniness and shinyness
herself, and so does Bessie; and they try
all they can to think people wouldn't do bad
things."</p>

<p>After the children had been dismissed for
the night, there was some discussion between
their parents whether or no it would be better
for Mabel to go to school till the mystery was
cleared up; but it was at last decided that
there should be no change, and she should go
as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"If she will," said Mrs. Walton, to which
her husband <span class="locked">replied,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I think, my dear, it is time that Mabel
was learning to do what she <em>must</em>, and not
what she <em>will</em>. I fear we have ourselves to
blame for much of this trouble, which has
arisen from the wilfulness and selfishness we
have too long overlooked."</p>

<p>But Mabel was so subdued by her trouble,
and by her sorrow for her past misconduct to
Belle, that she offered no resistance to going
to school the next day, further than to say
she did not want to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, dear!" said her father: "there
is no reason why you should not."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the children won't believe me
about Belle's locket," she whispered; "and
they'll look at me."</p>

<p>"But if you stay away it would seem as if
you were really guilty," said Mr. Walton.
"I do not think your school-mates will be
unkind to you; and if they are, you must bear
it as a part of the punishment for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
naughtiness to Belle. Mamma and I think
it better you should go. If you are innocent,
you need not be afraid."</p>

<p>And Mabel, quite broken-spirited, submitted
without any of the loud outcries with which
she usually met any opposition to her wishes.</p>

<p>"I know that they'll all be mad at me, and
point at me, and every thing," she sobbed, as
she started for school with Belle and the two
nurses.</p>

<p>"If any of them are so bad to you, I will
tell them to have 'love-charity;' and if they
don't, I won't be friends with them any more,
but be very offended with them indeed," said
Belle, forgetting that her new rule could work
more ways than one, and hold good for others
than Mabel. Just now she was so full of forgiving
pity and sympathy for her cousin that
she thought only of helping her and doing
battle in her behalf.</p>

<p>Mabel's fears were well founded, as it
proved. She was met with looks askance,
and cold words; while Belle was greeted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
a more than usual share of affection. And
Dora Johnson, who was not very careful of
other people's feelings, and was apt to say
rather rude and unkind things without much
thought, said in a whisper, loud enough for
Mabel to <span class="locked">hear,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Before I'd come to school if I was a
locket-thief!"</p>

<p>Belle heard this too, and at once fired up
in Mabel's defence.</p>

<p>"Before I would too, and before Mabel
would!" she said, her bright eyes flashing
with indignation as she took her cousin's
hand in a protecting manner; "and because
she isn't a thief is the reason she comes; and
she only took it out of my desk to look at, and
didn't mean to steal it a bit. But somebody
else must have: I don't know who. And if
everybody don't be friends with her, they
needn't be friends with me either; and I
won't have 'em, but will be awfully mad
with 'em."</p>

<p>Belle's speech was not perhaps very coherent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but it was understood by all, and had its
effect. For since <em>she</em> believed that Mabel had
not the locket, the rest thought that she must
have some good reason for her faith; and no
more was said in words, though poor Mabel
could not but feel that she was curiously and
suspiciously gazed at by every child in the
school, as if they expected to read her guilt
or innocence written on her face. Still, on
the whole, matters were not so bad as she had
feared they would be. Miss Ashton was as
kind and gentle as usual, and, like her own
family, seemed to wish to believe her innocent
till she was proved guilty; while Belle was
more affectionate and patronizing than she
had ever been before, and returned with
reproachful or defiant looks every cold or
scornful glance that fell to Mabel's share.
The search of the cloak-room for the missing
treasure had proved quite fruitless. Miss
Ashton had taken the trouble to have every
thing moved from the room, the floor had
been thoroughly swept, and even the corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and edges of the carpet turned up; but all in
vain. There was no trace of the lost locket;
and Miss Ashton and her mother had decided
that they could only wait and see what time
would do. Whoever had taken it, such a
thing could not remain long hidden: it must
be discovered and brought home to the guilty
child.</p>

<p>So Miss Ashton told Mrs. Walton when
she called to see her again on this unhappy
matter; and she would not say, though she
gave Mabel the benefit of the doubt, that in
her heart she believed her to be that child;
and the mother could only hope and pray that
it might not be so.</p>

<p>Still it was a most uncomfortable and
unhappy matter. Such a thing had never
happened before in the little school; and it
was sad to believe that there was a thief
among that young group.</p>

<p>But good was brought out of all this discomfort
and unhappiness. The change in
Mabel was surprising as well as encouraging.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
She clung to Belle, and to Belle's faith in her,
in a way that was really touching, and which
went far to convince her friends and teacher
that she was really innocent of more than she
had confessed. And, contrary to her usual
custom, she did not try to excuse herself for
what she had done, but was truly penitent,
and ready to acknowledge that this trouble
had arisen from her own fault. If Belle
would have taken them, she would have thrust
upon her all her own possessions; and now
whenever she saw a pretty thing, she wanted
it, not for herself, but for Belle, and was constantly
begging her papa and mamma to buy
this, that, and the other for her little cousin.
And as she became more and more unselfish
and yielding towards Belle, she became so
towards others, and more obedient and docile
to her parents; till the self-willed, outrageous,
spoiled elf seemed really changing and quieting
down into a tolerably well-behaved, reasonable
little child.</p>

<p>That she was really repentant and desirous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to make amends to Belle, she showed in a
very decided manner when her birthday came
around, as it did about three weeks after the
loss of the locket.</p>

<p>At this time her Grandmamma Walton
was accustomed to send her two gold half-eagles;
a large sum for a child like Mabel, and
which the old lady probably supposed was put
away with care, or used to some good purpose.
But hitherto it had always been frittered away
in toys, candies, and so forth, Mabel claiming
such and such portions of it to spend when
some trifle struck her fancy.</p>

<p>At the time the locket was first lost, her
mother had told her that it would be a good
thing if she should spend the money which
would come on her next birthday on a new
one for Belle; and Mabel had readily agreed.
But Mr. Walton, knowing nothing of her
good intentions, had bought a handsome
locket, and given it to Belle to take the place,
as far as might be, of the one which was
gone. Belle had thanked him prettily, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
admired the gift; then gave it to Daphne to
put away.</p>

<p>"Where I can't see it, Daffy, 'cause it
makes me feel like crying when I think it
was not a bit my own mamma's like that
other one I lost."</p>

<p>It was in vain that Daphne tried to persuade
her to wear it: the child seemed to have
a half romantic, but touching sensitiveness
on the subject, which could not be overcome.</p>

<p>But Belle now having her uncle's gift,
Mrs. Walton told Mabel that she could spend
the money in some other way to gratify her
cousin; and Mabel thought of first one thing,
then another, which she could purchase for
Belle.</p>

<p>But she had not yet decided upon any
thing when her birthday came, and with it
the usual gift from her grandmother. Running
into Belle's nursery on that morning, she
found her little cousin standing by the side
of old Daphne, who, with her hands over her
face, was rocking herself to and fro, moaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and crying, while Belle seemed to be
trying to comfort her. Near by stood another
colored woman, looking troubled also, though
not in the deep distress which Daphne showed.
In Daphne's lap laid the contents of Belle's
little purse and money-box,&mdash;pennies, five
and ten cent pieces, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mabel stood a moment in wonder at this
unusual state of affairs; and then, full of the
business which had brought her, broke forth
<span class="locked">with,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Belle! Belle! Make Daphne dress you
very quick. Papa is going to take us out to
buy something very nice for you with a whole
lot of money grandmamma sent me; and then
he is going to take us for a nice long drive in
the Park, and let us run about and feed the
swans and see the animals. Make haste!
make haste!"</p>

<p>Belle shook her head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I can't leave Daphne, Mabel," she said.
"She has a great trouble. Somebody went
and did something naughty, and the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
thought it was Daphne's boy,"&mdash;Daphne's
boy was her grandson,&mdash;"and they've taken
him to prison; but this woman knew it wasn't
him, and they say he can come out if he can
get a whole lot of money; and this woman
came to tell Daphne; but she hasn't money
enough, and I haven't either, and papa has
gone away to Philadelphia, and won't come
back till day after to-morrow; and what can
we do?" and Belle's eyes filled, as she told
the story of her old nurse's trouble.</p>

<p>"And won't you come?" said Mabel.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Mabel: I couldn't."</p>

<p>"Now go, and take yer pleasure, my
honey," said Daphne, ever-mindful of her little
lady's happiness. "I'll make you ready."</p>

<p>"No, no, Daffy: I couldn't leave you. Oh!
I do wish papa was home. He would fix it
all, and get poor Peter out of prison. You
are real good, Mabel; but I couldn't care
much about the very prettiest present if I
had to leave Daphne all alone when she is
so sorry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel hesitated, and thought of those two
bright golden pieces. Here was a chance to
give Belle a real pleasure, if she chose. She
knew Belle well enough to feel sure that she
would far rather help her old nurse out of
this trouble than to have the most beautiful
gift for herself; and Mabel believed that any
thing might be done with that sum of money,
which was her own to spend as she pleased.</p>

<p>But, as we know, Mabel and Daphne had
never been, and were not yet, the best of
friends; and it was partly Daphne's fault too.
She had no faith in Mabel's improvement,
and watched with disdainful and unbelieving
eyes her little attempts to be less selfish and
wilful. And Mabel knew this, and returned
the old woman's dislike with all her little
might. So how could she resolve to give up
her cherished plan for Daphne's relief? To
be sure, it would give Belle more pleasure,
but it would give far less to herself; and,
indeed, she was not quite sure that she did
not feel just the least satisfaction in Daphne's
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"It serves her right for being so cross to
me all the time," she said to herself; but
then came a feeling of shame at the unkind
thought, and she was glad that Belle did not
know of it.</p>

<p>"Belle would give the money if it was
hers, to get Peter out of prison, I know," she
thought, nothing doubting that the two half-eagles
could do this; "and maybe it would
be the best way to show her I do love her, and
am sorry for being so naughty to her about
the locket. I'll just do it; but I better do it
pretty quick or I'll change my mind about it,
'cause I don't want to one bit."</p>

<p>She rushed from the room, leaving Belle to
think that she was vexed at her refusal to go
out with her; but in two minutes she was
back with the gold pieces, which she thrust
into Belle's hand, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"There, Belle, if you would rather take
that black boy out of prison than have a
pretty present for you and me to play with,
you may. I will give you my money for it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
but I don't do it 'cause I love Daphne, not
one bit."</p>

<p>It was not a very gracious way of bestowing
a favor, it was true; but it was such a
piece of unwonted self-denial from Mabel that
her hearers were all taken by surprise, and
did not know what to say. Belle stood with
the gold pieces in her open hand, looking from
them to Mabel, and then at Daphne, who was
looking amazed and bewildered in her turn.</p>

<p>But now Mrs. Walton appeared.</p>

<p>When Mabel had run back to her mamma's
room for her half-eagles, as she took them
from her box she told some incoherent story,
which Mrs. Walton had not understood, but
which speedily brought her after her little
girl to see what was to be the fate of the
money. There was no knowing what freak
might have taken the child.</p>

<p>"I want Belle to take those to bring
Daphne's black boy out of prison, mamma;
and she seems as if she didn't want to," said
Mabel, half-pouting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Daphne understood; and, rising,
courtesied to Mrs. Walton, and told her
story; ending by saying that she had not
known what Miss Mabel meant, and she
begged Mrs. Walton's pardon, and she had
not thought of taking the child's money:
"Bress her heart! an' I didn't desarve it,
cos I did take such a scunner at her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Walton seized Mabel in her arms, and
covered her with kisses; while she lavished
upon her the most extravagant words of
praise and admiration. Mabel had expected
this when her mother should come to hear of
her offer to Daphne; and, more than this, she
had been farther helped to make it by the
belief that her mother would not let her be
a loser.</p>

<p>"But you shall not spend your birthday
gift for that, my darling," she said: "perhaps
papa can see to it until Uncle Frederick comes
home. We will go and ask him, and tell him
what a good, generous girl you are."</p>

<p>Far wiser would it have been if Mrs. Walton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
had let Mabel learn to do good to others
by making some sacrifice of her own wishes;
but she could not bear to have her darling
deprived of the slightest pleasure, on this day
of all others. So bidding Daphne take heart
till she should see what Mr. Walton said, she
took both children with her to tell him the
story.</p>

<p>Mr. Walton listened, and then kindly said
he would go and find out the truth of the case
at once; and if he thought it right, he would
give bail for the lad, for that was what was
needed.</p>

<p>"But," he said, "if I do this, I should go at
once, that Daphne and her boy may not be
kept in misery longer than is necessary; and
then my little girls must lose their promised
morning in the Park. The promise was made
to you first: are you both willing to give up
this pleasure for Daphne's sake?"</p>

<p>There was no doubt about Belle; but, as
Mr. Walton added, "it was Mabel's birthday,
and she must decide."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Now indeed Mabel's generosity and self
denial were put to the proof, certainly far
more than Belle's. The latter loved her
faithful old nurse too dearly to hesitate for
one instant; and, even had it not been so, the
sacrifice was by no means so great for her as
for Mabel. The Park with all its attractions
was no new thing to Belle: many a drive and
ramble had she had there; but to Mabel,
who was a stranger in the city, it was not so
familiar, and had not yet lost its first charm
for her. And she had been so delighted with
the thought of passing the morning there!
How could she give it up for Daphne?</p>

<p>Her father waited for her answer, and
would not let his wife speak when she would
have proposed some other plan; Belle watched
her with wistful eyes; and she could not make
up her mind to the sacrifice. She hesitated,
pouted, frowned; and there were all the
signs of a coming storm.</p>

<p>"Very well," said her father, gravely. "I
had hoped that my Mabel was really learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to care a little for others, but I fear it is not
so. It must be as she decides. We will go
for our pleasure, leaving Daphne's boy to stay
another day in prison, for I have other business
to attend to later in the day; or we will
give up this little treat to save her and him
much suffering. Which shall it be, Mabel?"</p>

<p>"I said she could have my birthday money,"
whimpered Mabel; "and mamma said I was
as generous as any thing."</p>

<p>"Ah! it did not cost you much to give up
the money, my child," said her father. "You
and Belle have more toys and pretty things
now than you know what to do with; but you
are not generous enough to give up that on
which you have really set your heart."</p>

<p>Mabel looked over at Belle once more, and
as she met the beseeching look in her eyes
remembered that here was really the chance
to show her cousin that she wished to make
up for her past unkindness.</p>

<p>She dropped the pocket-handkerchief which
she was pettishly twisting into a string, lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
her raised shoulders, and running to
Belle threw her arms about her neck, and
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"We'll give up the Park, and let papa go
to let out Peter, Belle,&mdash;so we will. I'll be
generous, even if I don't want to."</p>

<p>So it was settled, and Mr. Walton went on
his errand of mercy; of which I need say no
more than that it was successful, and Peter
set free, to the joy of Belle and Daphne.</p>

<p class="dropcap">A fortnight, three, four, five weeks
passed away; and still nothing had
been seen or heard of Belle's lost
treasure. For the first few days the children
could talk of nothing else; and it was only
Belle's determination to stand fast by her
cousin and take her part, that prevented them
from treating Mabel with open slights and
coldness. Dark looks and cool words would
certainly have fallen to her portion, but for
Belle; and she knew and felt this, and it is
only justice to her to say that she was grateful
to Belle accordingly.</p>

<p>But by and by the affair became an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
story, as every thing does in time, and the
children ceased to wonder over it; and Mabel,
though never much of a favorite, was allowed
to come with them and join in their games as
usual. Only the little cousins thought much
about the locket; Belle still grieving over her
loss, and Mabel mourning it almost as much,
with a feeling of guilt and shame added to
her sorrow for her cousin's sake.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing could have done Mabel
more good than this sense of the wrong she
had done her cousin: it made her see how
indulgence in selfishness and wilfulness may
bring trouble and distress which we never
intended or dreamt of in our perverse mood.
Moreover she felt abashed whenever she remembered
that the most, if not all of her
school-mates, and perhaps her teacher too,
believed her guilty of even theft. It is not
usually good for people to be unjustly suspected;
but in this case it did Mabel no harm.
It made her less exacting and domineering at
school, and the wish to make amends to Belle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
made her more yielding and unselfish at home.
So her old bad habits were somewhat broken
in upon, and the praise and credit which she
gained from her parents and little cousin were
so pleasing to her that they caused her to
persevere and try to do still better. It was
not the best motive for improvement, to be
sure; but it was something gained in the
right way; and by and by Mabel came to the
discovery that she was really happier when
she was good than when she was naughty.</p>

<p>One day when she and Belle were paying a
visit to Maggie and Bessie, she gave what the
other children considered a very striking instance
of improvement. She had brought
with her a very beautiful doll, and to this doll
little Annie had taken a desperate fancy; but
it was not thought safe to trust it to her hold,
although she begged for it piteously. Baby
though she was, Annie knew that she never
obtained any thing by screaming for it; but
she pleaded for the doll, which was held
beyond her reach, with kisses and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
pretty, broken words, till it was hard to resist
her; while Mabel was surprised that she did
not scream and cry for that which she wanted
so much, and could not help thinking that the
little one behaved far better than she would
have done herself. And at length her heart
was moved so that she could refuse Annie no
longer, although no one had thought her
unreasonable to do so.</p>

<p>"S'pose I sit down here on the rug by
Annie, and let her hold it while I watch her
very carefully," she said to Nurse, who was
vainly trying to divert baby's attention by offering
her every thing else proper for her to have.</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear," said Mammy,
divided between the wish to indulge her
pet, and the fear that the doll would come
to harm in Annie's keeping.</p>

<p>"I'll be very careful of it," said Mabel.
"Put her down here by me, and I'll teach her
how to hold it nicely."</p>

<p>Nurse obeyed, and the baby was made
happy; while her little sisters and Belle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
looked on in pleased surprise at Mabel's
novel generosity.</p>

<p>"Mabel," said Maggie, "I'm going to make
you a compliment; and it is that I never saw
a child improve more than you do 'most every
day. I expect one of these days you'll be
quite a benefactor."</p>

<p>"I expect she will too," said Belle.
"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Somebody who is very generous and does
a great many kind things for people," said
Maggie.</p>

<p>"Then I'm certain you and Bessie are
benefactors," said Belle, pronouncing the
long word slowly, as if she were not quite
sure of it.</p>

<p>"We try to be," answered Maggie, demurely.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you are too, Belle," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"Yes: she just is," said Mabel. "But I
s'pose you don't think I am one."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;well&mdash;not quite," said Bessie,
not wishing to hurt Mabel's feelings, but too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
truthful to say what she did not think; "but
we have great hopes of you, Mabel. We
think it was pretty <em>benefacting</em> of you to let
Baby Annie have your new doll in her own
hands. It must have been pretty hard work."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie: "we didn't expect
it of you, Mabel; and we're very agreeably
disappointed in you."</p>

<p>Praise from her playmates was something
quite new and very pleasant to Mabel, and
she began to feel pretty well pleased with
herself.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with an air of superior
virtue, "I b'lieve I'm growing pretty good
now."</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to say that," said Bessie:
"you ought to say, 'Perhaps I am a little better
than I used to be, but I hope I'll be better
yet.'"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mabel, feeling that she
was not properly appreciated in her new
character.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Bessie, "it is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
fashion for people to talk about their own
goodness. They ought to wait and let other
people do it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mabel, "I'm sure you were
doing it; and so why can't I do it too?"</p>

<p>"But it's <em>yourself</em>, you know," said Maggie;
"and because 'every crow thinks her own
young one the blackest,' that is not any
reason for her to talk about it."</p>

<p>"Crows caw, not talk, Maggie," said Bessie,
the matter of fact.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" said Maggie, "the lesson out
of the proverb is all the same."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be proud about it," said
Mabel, quite humbly; "but I couldn't help
feeling a little nice when I thought I wasn't
so naughty as I used to be. Mamma says I
am better, and papa says so too."</p>

<p>"And we say so too," said Bessie, kissing
her, the first kiss she had ever given her of
her own free will; "and we are very glad of
it, Mabel."</p>

<p>"I think it was Belle that made me a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
girl," said Mabel: "she was so good to me, I
had to be. 'Least she was pretty mad with
me at first: wasn't you, Belle? And before
I did a thing to her too; but afterwards she
was real good to me. And you and Maggie
were good to me too; and everybody liked
you, so I thought it must be nice to be good,
and I would be too. And I b'lieve I do like
it better."</p>

<p>"You see example is better than practice,"
said Maggie, meaning "precept;" "and so
'cause Belle was good and kind herself, that
put you in a mind to be so; and that ought to
make you very happy, Belle. I find it is very
true that if 'evil communications corrupt good
manners,' good communications also corrupt
evil manners."</p>

<p>Little Belle had not said much while the
others were talking on this subject, but now
she said quite softly to <span class="locked">Bessie,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Bessie, do you think that I was a little
sunbeam to Mabel? You know I said I
wouldn't be; but papa told me that verse out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the Bible 'bout our Father making His sun
to shine on the evil and the good, and he said
that meant we ought to be good and like sunshine
to everybody, if they were good or if
they were bad."</p>

<p>"Yes: I do think you were, Belle,"
answered Bessie; "and I b'lieve our Father
was very pleased with you, 'cause you know
Mabel was pretty evil when she first came
here; and it was very hard for you, most of
all about the locket."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Belle, with a sigh; "and now
I've had to make up my mind never to find
my locket. Papa told me I had better. He
says there is no hope of finding it now."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maggie was congratulating Mabel
still further on her improved conduct.</p>

<p>"We're very glad, Mabel," she said, "that
we can be friends with you; for we wouldn't
have liked you to be 'a heathen man and a
publican' to us. We wouldn't like to be in that
case with anybody, but 'specially with Belle's
cousin, 'cause we're so very fond of her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"So am I," said Mabel, looking affectionately
over at Belle.</p>

<p>And this was true. Mabel had really learned
to love Belle dearly and to trust her entirely;
and, what was still better, she was becoming
anxious to copy the pretty lady-like behavior,
ready obedience, and sweet unselfishness,
which she saw practised in the daily life of
her cousin, and her little friends, Maggie and
Bessie Bradford.</p>

<p>Not that it must be thought that all went
smoothly on every occasion. Belle, as well as
Mabel, had a firm will and a high temper,
and she had been much indulged and somewhat
spoiled by her father and nurse; so that
now and then the two children would fall out
about some trifle, and perhaps have some
quick words, and, it might be, pout and sulk
at one another for a while. But Belle was
generally mindful of the "sunshine" she was
to shed about her, and so was soon ready to
make up and yield the disputed point; and
then Mabel would be shamed into repentance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and there would be harmony and peace
between them once more.</p>

<p>Yes: little Belle had truly proved a "sunbeam"
to Mabel, throwing light upon the
right way, and not only pointing it out to her
so plainly that she could not miss it, but making
it <em>look</em> so bright and attractive that she
turned with some willingness to walk there,
pleased to follow in the steps of her little
example.</p>

<p>And the sunshine which she set herself to
shed upon Mabel's way was reflected farther
still on all about them, till where there had
been discontent and weariness now reigned
harmony and happiness; and all was peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dora Johnson was a fat, chubby little thing,
round as a ball, and like the "Dumpling" her
school-mates called her; looking as if she was
never troubled by a pain or an ache. But she
was subject now and then to a pain and fulness
in her head, for which the best remedy
was a turn in the open air; and when one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
these attacks came on in school, Miss Ashton
always allowed her to go for this, knowing
that Dora was a child to be trusted, who
would return to her studies as soon as she
was able. Taken in time, they passed away
soon with but little trouble, and her kind
teacher was watchful to prevent them as far
as possible.</p>

<p>"Dora, my dear, does your head trouble
you?" asked Miss Ashton, as she saw the
child press her hand to her forehead, while
her face flushed suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," answered Dora, dropping her
book.</p>

<p>"Then wrap your cloak about you and go
for a turn on the piazza or in the garden, till
you are better," said the lady.</p>

<p>Dora gladly obeyed, thankful for the relief
which the fresh, bracing air would bring to
her throbbing head. Going for her cloak, she
threw it around her, ran downstairs and out
upon the piazza. Her step was light; and
whatever sound her little feet might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
made upon the floor was drowned by the loud
and continuous hammering made by some
workmen, who were tinning the roof of a
neighboring house.</p>

<p>Dora walked once or twice the length of
the piazza, and was beginning to feel better,
when she heard the sound of voices below;
and presently she saw the cook come out from
the kitchen-door, followed by Marcia, the
colored girl. Cook had a large bundle in her
arm, and was evidently going out.</p>

<p>A door in the side of the garden-wall
opened upon the street which bounded one
side of it; and, unfastening this, the cook
passed out, saying to <span class="locked">Marcia,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Now mind and keep the door shut; and
don't you be poking your head out, and leaving
your work."</p>

<p>With which she disappeared; and Marcia
shut and bolted the door, then cut one or two
foolish antics as though she were pleased to
be rid of her. She did not see Dora; for the
end of the piazza where the little girl stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
looking out at her was screened by a lattice
over which ran a vine. There were no leaves
on the vine now, it is true; but the stems and
tendrils helped to make that corner a good
hiding-place from any one who stood below.</p>

<p>Dora had no thought of hiding from Marcia;
and she was about to speak to her, when she
saw the colored girl, after looking carefully
about her, stoop down, and with a bit of stick
begin to poke and pry between the stones at
the bottom of the wall, which was somewhat
out of repair at this part, and showed one or
two large cracks running along just above the
ground.</p>

<p>"What can she be doing?" thought Dora;
and curiosity held her silent till she should
see what Marcia would be at.</p>

<p>Though hidden herself, she could see the
girl very well, peeping down at her, as she
did, through the lattice and the vine.</p>

<p>Marcia pried and pried, stopping now and
then to look about her and listen, as if afraid
of being caught; and at last fished up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
between the stones something glittering
which looked like&mdash;was it possible?&mdash;Dora
thought it looked like a slender chain with
something hanging to it. Could it be?&mdash;was
it&mdash;Belle's locket?</p>

<p>She darted from her corner, along the
piazza, down the steps leading to the garden,
and around to the side of the wall where
Marcia was; but the girl saw and heard her
coming, and before she reached her the thing
she had held in her hand was dropped again
into its hiding-place between the stones.</p>

<p>Yet not so quickly but that Dora saw the motion
of Marcia's hand, and she was more than
ever convinced that something was wrong.</p>

<p>They stood and faced one another, the little
lady and the colored girl: the former, stern
and indignant, as became one who had caught
a culprit in the act; the other, sheepish and
guilty, wriggling her shoulders uneasily, and
not daring to meet the eye which accused her.</p>

<p>"Give me that," said Dora, severely.</p>

<p>"Give you what, Miss Johnson?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Marcia, twisting and wriggling more than
ever and vainly trying to put on an air of
innocence.</p>

<p>"What you had in your hand. I b'lieve
you've put it back in the wall, but you'll have
to let me see it," said Dora.</p>

<p>"I ain't got nothin', Miss; and I s'pect
Miss Ashton wants you. I hear her callin',"
said Marcia.</p>

<p>"She's not calling, and if she was I wouldn't
go till I knew what that was," answered Dora,
firmly. "She'll excuse me when I tell her
why."</p>

<p>Marcia persisted, and insisted that she had
had nothing in her hand; but Dora knew
better. And though the girl tried every device
to rid herself of the young lady, she was not
to be moved. She would mount guard over
that hidden thing till she learned what it was,
if she stood there all day.</p>

<p>Equally determined was Marcia; but she
coaxed and threatened and tried to frighten
in vain. Dora was a child of too much sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to be at all disturbed by the stories she told
of what would happen to her; treated with
scorn all the bribes which Marcia promised;
and repeated over and over again her resolution
not to stir till she saw what was in that
crack.</p>

<p>As for Miss Ashton coming for her, it was
just what Dora wished for: she could tell her
teacher, and leave the matter in her hands,
sure that she would find means of coming at
the truth. And now there was Nelly Ransom's
voice making itself heard.</p>

<p>"Dora! Dora! Where are you? Miss
Ashton wants to know if you are worse."</p>

<p>"Come here, Nelly," said Dora; while
Marcia grew more and more uneasy as she
found the toils of her own wickedness closing
down and down upon her. "You go and ask
Miss Ashton to come here very quick. I've
made a great discovery. Make haste."</p>

<p>Nelly obeyed, wondering much; and Miss
Ashton, rather alarmed, speedily appeared on
the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Marcia, seeing that all was lost now, did
not wait for her wickedness to be revealed;
but, as the young lady came down the steps,
shot away around the other side of the house
and out of sight.</p>

<p>Dora's story was soon told, and the crack
pointed out; in another moment the little girl
and her teacher were busy following Marcia's
example, and with bits of crooked stick trying
to poke out the hidden "shiny thing," as
Dora called it,&mdash;not yet sure enough to say
the <em>locket</em>.</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Ashton," said the excited child,
"I feel something,&mdash;I do, I do!" and the next
moment she drew up with her hooked stick&mdash;the
locket!&mdash;yes, Belle's long-lost locket!</p>

<p>Dora's joy and exultation knew no bounds;
and she would have rushed away with it to the
school-room at once, had not Miss Ashton
stopped her.</p>

<p>"Let me be the one to take it to Belle.
Oh! do, Miss Ashton. I was the finder out,"
said the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you shall give it to her; but I cannot
have the class excited and disturbed just now,"
said the lady. "Besides, I want to know how
this came here."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Ashton," said Dora, "I don't
think I could keep it in. And then Mabel,
poor Mabel! you wouldn't let any one think
she stole it a minute longer, would you? Oh!
I am so sorry I believed it of her, and was so
ugly to her about it."</p>

<p>There was reason in Dora's words; and
Miss Ashton, knowing that the curiosity of
her young flock must already be excited,
concluded to let her reveal her prize, although
she felt sure that there would be little more
study that morning if she did so.</p>

<p>It was singular how the locket should have
come into Marcia's possession, and she did not
yet feel that Mabel was quite cleared. But
she gave Dora leave to make her good news
known, and to restore the locket to Belle.</p>

<p>Away rushed Dora, and running into the
school-room held aloft her prize, crying <span class="locked">out,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Found! Found! and I did it, Belle and
Mabel!"</p>

<p>Miss Ashton following close on Dora's steps
found her class in quite as much commotion
as she had expected. Belle, with the recovered
locket held fast in her little hands, was covering
it with kisses, while tears and smiles were
struggling for the mastery. She flew into
Miss Ashton's arms the moment she appeared,
but could find no words for all that was in
her heart.</p>

<p>But this could not be said for any of the
others; for questions and exclamations were
poured forth in such numbers that it was
impossible to answer them all, and in spite
of Miss Ashton's warning "Sh! sh!" there
arose such a Babel of young voices that Mrs.
Ashton opened the door of her room and
asked the cause of the uproar.</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell upon the little ones
when her voice was heard; and then Miss
Ashton told in a few words where and how
the locket had been found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Belle waited till she was through, and then
slipping from her teacher's lap ran over to
Mabel, who sat sobbing at her desk; and the
two little cousins put their arms about one
another in a loving, congratulatory clasp.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mabel," said Belle, "I am so glad I
b'lieved you didn't have it. I would feel so
bad if I had."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad it's come out," sobbed Mabel,
with a look and tone which went far towards
convincing Miss Ashton that the child's story
had really been true, and that, however mysterious
it now seemed, Marcia in some way
had obtained possession of the locket without
Mabel's knowledge.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Dora, who had been one
of the most forward in believing Mabel guilty;
"and I'm so sorry I was hateful to you about
it, Mabel. I'll make up to you for it as long
as I live! See if I don't."</p>

<p>Congratulations were showered on both of
the little cousins; and Belle's pleasure in the
recovery of her locket was increased tenfold
by knowing that Mabel was cleared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>For when, after some difficulty, Marcia was
forced to confess how she had come by the
locket, she said that on the day when she had
been allowed to go to her sick sister, she had
forgotten a bundle she was to take with her,
and returned for it. Finding the gate unfastened,
she came in without ringing, entered
the house, and went up to her room without
notice. But on the way up she saw Mabel
run out from the school-room into the cloak-room,
and peeping at her through the crack
of the door saw her throw down some glittering
object and cover it with her hat and sacque.
She passed on her way; but, as she came
down, was tempted to go in and see what the
young lady had been hiding. At first it was
only curiosity; but when she saw the pretty
thing, the wish to have it came over her, and,
the temptation proving too strong, she snatched
it up, put the cloak and hat as she had found
them, and ran away out of the house as quietly
as possible, no one knowing that she had
returned. But she dared not let any one see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the locket, and she had put it for safe hiding in
the crack in the wall, whence she could take
it out once in a while and look at it. But it
had been more trouble than pleasure to her;
for Marcia had been taught better, and found
truly that "the way of transgressors is hard."</p>

<p>She was not very penitent now, but very
much frightened, believing that she would be
sent to prison. This was not done of course;
but Marcia's sin had deprived her of a good
home and its comforts. Mrs. Ashton would
have kept her, and still tried to do her good,
if she had not had her young pupils to consider;
but Marcia had been much given to pilfering
of late; and this fault, so serious in any
place, was particularly so in a school. So
Marcia must go, in spite of all her promises,&mdash;promises
made so often before, and so often
broken. Mrs. and Miss Ashton still kept an
eye upon her, and did what they could to
befriend her; but she lost much through a
sin which had brought her not the smallest
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>And now we will say good-by for a while
to Belle and Mabel; hoping that the latter,
profiting by the lessons and example set
before her, may also learn to draw light and
brightness from the Sun of Righteousness,
and herself prove a little sunbeam to all
about her path.</p>
